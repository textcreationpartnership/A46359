            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Afflicted <hi>Church</hi> ſeeks for conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation: where can ſhe find it, but in the <hi>Promiſes of God?</hi> when the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent proſpect is ſad and dolefull, we muſt ſearch for it in what is future. The promiſes of God are either General, or Perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular. The <hi>general Promiſes</hi> are ſuch, as aſſure us in the general, that God will not caſt off his children; that this Grace ſhall never forſake his <hi>Church;</hi> that he will be with them to the end of the World; that though the mountains be overthrown, he will not depart from them. But afflicted perſons would be glad of ſomething more perticular: they would be willing to ſee, in ſome <hi>particular Promiſes,</hi> near about what Time they may expect the Period of their Calamities. Now the Promiſes and this inſight into the future, is no where to be had but in the <hi>Prophecies:</hi> They doubtleſs contain the <hi>promiſes</hi> which reſpect the Deliverance of the <hi>Church;</hi> yea, they ſet forth the very Time, and the circumſtances of it. But as God hath cauſed the <hi>Prophecies</hi> to be written more for his own glory, than for our ſakes, 'tis almoſt impoſſible to dive into the meaning of them till their <hi>accomplishment.</hi>
               <note place="margin">The depth of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies.</note> And experience teacheth us, that even after the Things are come to paſs, we do not well underſtand the <hi>Prophecies</hi> which foretold 'em. Inſomuch, that it may be ſaid, that God hath rather concealed Things in the <hi>Prophecies,</hi> than thereby revealed 'em. He hath
<pb facs="tcp:95320:4"/>reſerved to himſelf the knowledge of Futurity; 'Tis his Prerogative. Nevertheleſs, this is not to be taken in that ſtrict and rigid ſenſe, as if we were to reckon all the <hi>Prophecies</hi> to be unintelligible to all men, and in every age to be ſo. As his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence hath preſided in a peculiar manner, in <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing the Prophecies;</hi> ſo 'tis certain, it doth perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly direct and govern, as to what concerns the interpretation of them. God will not that they ſhould be underſtood in every age; But from <hi>age</hi> to <hi>age,</hi> from <hi>year</hi> to <hi>year,</hi> his Spirit diſcovers to Interpreters what he thinks fit; and leaves the reſt under a vail of Ignorance, till the fixed time which his wiſdom hath appointed ſhall come, for the full and perfect revelation of it.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">They are not Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrable.</note>We are not therefore to be diſcouraged by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the difficulty; we are not to look upon the <hi>Prophecies</hi> as abſolutely impenetrable. We muſt <hi>ſeek,</hi> that we may <hi>find;</hi> we muſt <hi>ask,</hi> that we may <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive;</hi> we muſt humbly and devoutly <hi>knock</hi> at the Gate of Heaven, that it may be <hi>open'd</hi> to us. We are obliged to thoſe <hi>Interpreters</hi> who have gone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us; for if they had diſcovered nothing, it may be, no entrance being made, we ſhould never have attained the knowledge of theſe myſterious truths. But we are not to ſtop at their labours, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſce in what they have done, as if they had ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded well in every thing. This is ſo far from being true, that the contrary is much more ſo. For one Truth which they have hit upon, they have miſs't ſeveral. The misforture of other <hi>Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters</hi> hath not diſheartn'd <hi>me,</hi> hoping that I have diſcovered many things, which to them were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed. But I may ſay, that I did not out of choice apply my ſelf to the ſtudy of the <hi>Prophecies:</hi> I found my ſelf forced to it by a kind of violence, which I could not reſiſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:95320:4"/>
Two things led me to it.
<list>
                  <item>1. The cruel and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible <hi>Perſecution,</hi> which at <hi>this day</hi> makes ſuch ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible ravage and deſolation in the <hi>Church:</hi> Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring ſome conſolation under the deepeſt ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row I ever felt, by ſearching into the grounds, we may have to hope for a ſpeedy <hi>deliverance of the Church,</hi> and not finding them other where, I inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red after them in the <hi>Prophecies,</hi> which foretell the deſtiny of the <hi>Church,</hi> and the moſt remarkable changes through which ſhe is to paſs.</item>
                  <item>2. The next thing that made me reſolve to dive into theſe ſacred <hi>Oracles,</hi> was the concurrence of ſo many <hi>Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,</hi> (obſcure indeed, &amp; of an uncertain and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full original,) which fore-tell a ſpeedy and perfect Deliverance of the <hi>Church.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
For Example,<note place="margin">The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of modern Prophecies concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the fall of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt.</note> the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous <hi>Prophecy</hi> of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>sher Arch-bishop of Armagh,</hi> who fore-tells <hi>a moſt terrible Perſecution at hand,</hi> the moſt dreadfull of any which the Church hath ſuffer'd hitherto; but withal, the <hi>shorteſt:</hi> after which ſhall come the <hi>fall</hi> of the <hi>Antichriſtian Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire.</hi> The <hi>Prophecies</hi> of <hi>Cotterus, Chriſtina Ponia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touski,</hi> and thoſe of <hi>Drabitius,</hi> and ſeveral other more obſcure ones, which I have heard and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, without giving much credit to'em.</p>
            <p>I compared theſe <hi>Prophecies</hi> ſo univerſally ſpread, and coming from ſo many ſeveral places, to the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral rumours about the time of the birth of Chriſt, that were every where divulged throughout the <hi>Roman Empire,</hi> of a <hi>Great King that should be born in the Eaſt, to whom all the World ſhould pay obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance.</hi> I did not find my ſelf much diſpoſed to give credit to thoſe <hi>modern Prophecies.</hi> Credulity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ordinary ſource of much deluſion, I always ſtood upon my guard in that perticular as much as poſſible. Nevertheleſs, I could not but be toucht with a ſecret opinion, that in all this there might be
<pb facs="tcp:95320:5"/>ſomething more then humane, ſomething of an hand of Providence therein. As the Holy Virgin, <hi>I kept theſe ſayings in my heart,</hi> without paſſing a judgement, I waited till farther Time, (which is the only true Touch-ſtone) would diſtinguiſh foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh viſions from real Prophecies.</p>
            <p>I found ſomething ſurprizing and extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, in the <hi>Prophecies</hi> of <hi>Cotterus, Chriſtina,</hi> and <hi>Drabitius,</hi> which are publiſht by <hi>Comenius. Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terus,</hi> who is the firſt of the Three, is Great and magnifick; the <hi>images</hi> of his <hi>viſions</hi> have ſo much majeſty and grandeur, that thoſe of the ancient Prophets have hardly more. They are alſo admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably laid together, every thing ſupports it ſelf, and one part doth not contradict another. I cannot conceive how a <hi>ſimple Artiſan</hi> could have imagined ſuch great things without Divine aſſiſtance. The <hi>two years</hi> of the Prophecy of <hi>Chriſtina,</hi> are in my judgement a train of as great <hi>Miracles</hi> as have ever been ſince the Apoſtles days, and even the Life of the Greateſt Prophets hath nothing in it more mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous, than what happened to that <hi>maid. Drabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> hath alſo his Heights and Excellencies, but for the moſt part he is obſcure. Theſe <hi>three Prophets</hi> concur to fore-tell the <hi>Ruin</hi> of the <hi>Antichriſtian Empire,</hi> as a thing that ſhall <hi>shortly</hi> come to paſs; but withal they have ſo many things that offend, that no man can ſatisfy himſelf to rely upon what they ſay. Therefore I reſolved to look into the Fountain it ſelf of the <hi>Holy Oracles,</hi> to ſee if the Holy Ghoſt would not teach me ſomething more certain and more exact, concerning the <hi>approaching ruin</hi> of the <hi>Antichriſtian Empire,</hi> than what other <hi>Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters</hi> have diſcovered from thence.</p>
            <p>I will freely acknowledge, that when I firſt lookt into the Divine <hi>Oracles,</hi> my opinion was in favour
<pb facs="tcp:95320:5"/>of what I ſearcht for; being altogether inclined to believe, that we were near the <hi>end</hi> of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Empire of <hi>Antichriſt.</hi> I was alſo fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded of this truth, that <hi>the Papacy is the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian Empire;</hi> and that the principal <hi>Character</hi> of that <hi>Antichriſtianiſm,</hi> is the <hi>ſuperſtition</hi> which for more than <hi>twelve hundred years</hi> hath disfigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the <hi>Church,</hi> and made her deſolate. Many things, without reckoning the <hi>modern Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,</hi> made me Hope, that we were near the end of that Period of 1260 <hi>years,</hi> at the cloſe whereof <hi>Babylon</hi> muſt fall, the <hi>Heathen</hi> be converted, and the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt be fully ſettled.</p>

               <hi>Firſt,</hi> I reflected on the long duration of that <hi>Idolatry,</hi> which hath been eſtabliſht in the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion.</hi> I ſaw that it began about the end of the <hi>fourth Century,</hi> that is, thirteen hundred <hi>years</hi> ago; it ſeem'd to me, that no inſtance could be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, where God ſuffered ſo great a Corruption, for ſo long a time, without giving ſome remedy and relief. I conſidered farther, that in the laſt age, God gave a terrible blow to the <hi>Antichriſtian Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire</hi> and the Pagan Religion. The Kingdoms of <hi>England, Swede, Denmark, the Proteſtant States of Germany, the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Provinces,</hi> the <hi>Switzers,</hi> and a great part of <hi>France,</hi> broke from the <hi>Papacy</hi> all at once, appeared to me ſo conſiderable a matter, that I could nor perſwade my ſelf, but that God had made mention of it in the <hi>Revelations.</hi> And yet I found no ſuch thing among the <hi>Expoſitors</hi> of that <hi>Book:</hi> or I found that they had lookt for it in thoſe Places, where I ſaw plainly that it was not. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon I ſuſpected, that that part of the <hi>Apocalypſe,</hi> which deſcribes the degrees and Circumſtances of the <hi>end</hi> of the <hi>Antichriſtian Empire,</hi> was not well
<pb facs="tcp:95320:6"/>underſtood; and conſequently, that it was much <hi>nearer</hi> than was commonly thought.</p>
            <p>Conſidering the <hi>Reformation</hi> of the laſt Age, as <hi>one half</hi> of the ruin of the <hi>Kingdom of Antichriſt,</hi> I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed that the <hi>other half</hi> could not be far off, there being already near 200 <hi>years</hi> from the one to the other. When God makes great Empires <hi>fall,</hi> and not all at once; the diſtance is not commonly ſo great between the firſt part of the <hi>Fall</hi> and the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond.</p>
            <p>After this, I conſidered the preſent poſture of the <hi>World,</hi> and it ſeem'd to me, as if all things were prepared for ſome great <hi>Revolution.</hi> 'Tis as eaſy with God to work in one moment, and without preceding diſpoſitions, as to take time, and prepare the matter. Nevertheleſs, we ſee that by ſecret methods, which men perceive not, he opens the way to his greateſt works. For Example, the <hi>Fall of Paganiſm</hi> by the preaching of the Goſpel, and the converſion of the <hi>Heathen World,</hi> was a great Revolution. God prepared all things for this great Event many ages before it came to paſs, by admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable means, of which no man then knew the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency and deſign.
<list>
                  <item>1. He reduced the World to <hi>two</hi> Languages, which were almoſt univerſal, the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latine,</hi> that the knowledge of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel might the more eaſily be communicated; Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of Languages being a great hinderance of ſuch a communication. 'Tis true, the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> had the gift of Tongues, and could ſpeak all <hi>Languages;</hi> but we are not to imagine, that all the Preachers of the Goſpel had the ſame priviledge.</item>
                  <item>2. The <hi>world</hi> was almoſt wholly united under one <hi>Empire, viz.</hi> the <hi>Roman:</hi> which was another means to facili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate the Converſion of the Nations. For if the <hi>Earth</hi> had been divided into many little Principalities, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb facs="tcp:95320:6"/>ſeveral Soyeraigns, as the <hi>Weſt</hi> is at this day, it had been as it were impoſſible, but that divers of them, if not the moſt part, would have denied en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance to the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> who were the new Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers. Little <hi>Lords,</hi> who have not much to do, concern themſelves more particularly about every part of their Territories, than <hi>great Emperors,</hi> who having the Government of the whole World to mind, are forc't to remit the care of leſs important matters, to their Deputies and Lieutenants.</item>
                  <item>3. The diſperſion of the <hi>Jews</hi> by their frequent Captivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, was alſo a means which God made uſe of to prepare the way for the Converſion of the <hi>Gentiles:</hi> they gave them the knowledge of the true God.</item>
                  <item>4. Another thing which contributed very much to this deſign of God, was the Tranſlation of the <hi>Bible</hi> into the <hi>Greek</hi> Tongue; whereby the <hi>ſacred Oracles</hi> became common among the <hi>Heathens.</hi> And about the time of our Saviour's appearance in the World, there were multitudes of thoſe <hi>Proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites,</hi> which are called <hi>Proſelites of the Gate.</hi> Such as were not really <hi>Iews,</hi> but they ceas't to be <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans.</hi> They renounc't their <hi>Idolatry,</hi> they were preſent every <hi>Sabbath day</hi> at the reading of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the <hi>Prophets;</hi> they had a diſtinct place in the Synagogues. 'Tis of them we ſo often read in the Book of the <hi>Acts,</hi> under the name of <hi>devout,</hi> and ſuch <hi>as feared God</hi> among the Gentiles: <hi>Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> was of that number. It could not be diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult for them to abandon <hi>Paganiſm,</hi> for they had already left it, and they could not be hindred from becoming Chriſtians by <hi>Judaiſm,</hi> for they had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver imbrac't it; So that they became Chriſtians without change or violence; The greateſt part of the <hi>converted Gentiles</hi> were ſuch as theſe.</item>
                  <item>5. And by the ſame good Providence of God, <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:95320:7"/>began to flouriſh among the <hi>Pagans,</hi> a little before the coming of Chriſt, which was of great uſe to refine the minds of men, and render them capable of receiving celeſtial and ſublime Truths.</item>
                  <item>6. <hi>Laſtly,</hi> God poſſeſt the <hi>Heathen</hi> with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of <hi>Idolatry</hi> and <hi>Idols:</hi> They were diſguſted and ſick of their Gods: The falſe Oracles of <hi>Dae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi> ceas't, their <hi>Prieſts</hi> loſt their reputation, and all the World breath'd after a change, without knowing why.</item>

            <p>I find ſomething like this at preſent. 1. Since the <hi>laſt Age</hi> God hath revived the Light and knowledge of the <hi>Sciences,</hi> which was almoſt ſtifled and extinguiſht under the barbariſm of <hi>Scholaſtick Learning.</hi> In the laſt Century, God cauſed the knowledge of the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Hebrew</hi> Tongues to revive, which was of ſuch uſe for the underſtanding of the <hi>Holy Scripture,</hi> and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation of <hi>Hereſy</hi> and <hi>Idolatry,</hi> that the <hi>Papiſts</hi> do not ſcruple to ſay, that 'tis <hi>that</hi> which hath undone them. In this Century the Providence of God hath carried the acuteneſs and delicacy of mens minds to that degree, that it may truly be ſaid, that the moſt inlightned and refined <hi>Ages</hi> paſt, were barbarous in compariſon with <hi>this.</hi> The ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive <hi>Sciences</hi> and true <hi>Philoſophy</hi> are brought to that Perfection, that all that we had before may be reckoned ſimplicity and ignorance. This <hi>new Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy</hi> doth open and inlarge the mind, and the <hi>light</hi> we receive from <hi>modern Philoſophers</hi> doth help very much to ſcatter that thick <hi>darkneſs,</hi> which the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy</hi> of the <hi>Schools</hi> had caſt upon the Doctrines of <hi>Religion.</hi> We ſhall ſhortly know of what uſe the <hi>new Philoſophy</hi> may be to deſtroy thoſe Monſters of <hi>Transſubſtantiation</hi> and the <hi>Real Preſence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. I look upon the long <hi>Voyages</hi> of our <hi>Europaeans,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:95320:7"/>the diſcoveries made of new Countries in the <hi>Eaſt</hi> and <hi>Weſt,</hi> and the improvement of the <hi>Art of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigation,</hi> to be a means which God prepares for the fullfilling that great Promiſe that concerns the full <hi>Converſion of the Gentiles.</hi> Why did God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the <hi>Invention</hi> of the <hi>Sea Compaſs</hi> to theſe laſt times? why was it not known three or four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred <hi>years</hi> ago, what it was to ſail upon the Ocean far from the ſhore? was there leſs curioſity, cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs, or induſtry among men formerly than now? for what reaſon would God that one half of the World ſhould live in ignorance of the other for ſo long a time? Why hath God in theſe latter days more viſibly favour'd the <hi>deſigns</hi> which <hi>men</hi> have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways had, to inrich themſelves by <hi>Commerce</hi> and <hi>Trade,</hi> going in purſuit of riches to the end of the World? for my own part, I cannot but look upon this as a work of a moſt wiſe Providence, diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to us unknown <hi>People,</hi> whoſe Converſion he intends to bring about within a ſhort Time.</p>
            <p n="3">3. I conſider the great number of <hi>half Chriſtians</hi> which the <hi>Popish Miſſions</hi> make in the <hi>Indies,</hi> to be juſt as thoſe <hi>Proſelytes of the Gate,</hi> which the <hi>Iews</hi> made; they were properly neither <hi>Iews</hi> nor <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,</hi> but were the ſeed of Chriſtianity. Theſe <hi>Eaſtern Converts,</hi> which are made by <hi>Papiſts,</hi> are neither <hi>Heathens,</hi> nor <hi>Chriſtians:</hi> but they will be the firſt part of the <hi>Harveſt,</hi> which God intends to have among thoſe People; and after they are fully <hi>converted,</hi> they will be very ſerviceable for the <hi>Converſion</hi> of thoſe who as yet are altogether <hi>Pagans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. I admire the depth of Divine Providence, that by inſenſible ſteps and degrees, diſpoſeth the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humetan</hi> Nations for Converſion. For this we need but conſult the ſecond Book of <hi>the Preſent Stave of
<pb facs="tcp:95320:8"/>the Ottoman Empire,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Lib. 2. Chap. 2.</note> by <hi>Mr. Ricaut.</hi> In that Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory we meet with a Sect of Mahumetans, called <hi>Haictites; who believe that the Meſſiah took a true natural Body, and that being Eternal, he became In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnate, as the Chriſtians believe: Wherefore they have inſerted this Article into their confeſſion of Faith, that Chriſt shall come to judge the World at the laſt day. For the proof whereof they cite a Text out of the</hi> Alckoran <hi>in theſe words,</hi> O Mahomet! thou ſhalt ſee thy Lord, who ſhall come again in the Clouds. <q>For though they dare not poſitively interpret this of J. Chriſt, yet they boldly affirm, that this is fore-told of the <hi>Meſſiah;</hi> and in their ordinary diſcourſe, they confeſs, that this <hi>Meſſiah</hi> can be no other than <hi>Ieſus,</hi> who is to return into the World with the ſame fleſh which he aſſum'd.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The ſame Author tells us, <q>That there is an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion generally received among the Turks within a few years,<note place="margin">Chap. 12.</note> which is entertained by the beſt people of the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> &amp; common enough at <hi>Conſtantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</hi> They who profeſs to believe it, are called <hi>Chup Meſſahites, i. e.</hi> the good Partiſans or followers of the Meſſiah. They hold that Chriſt is God, and that he is the Redeemer of the World. The young Scholars in the Court of the grand <hi>Seignior</hi> are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally of this opinion: perticularly the moſt po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite and civilized, and well bred among them. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that 'tis a form of ſpeech very much in uſe among them, when they would praiſe any one, to ſay to him, <hi>Chup Meſſahiſen,</hi> you are very civil and obliging, as he ſhould be who makes profeſſion of the ſervice of the Meſſiah. There are a multitude of theſe People <hi>Conſtantinople;</hi> and there have been ſome who have maintained this Doctrine, which ſo much courage, that rather than quit it, they have choſen to ſuffer martyrdom.</q>

There is another Sect, called <hi>Eſchrakites.</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 407.</note>
               <q>They who profeſs it, addict themſelves very much to the contemplation of the Idea of the Divinity, and the numbers that are in God. For though they hold the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> of God, they nevertheleſs admit the <hi>Trinity</hi> alſo, as a number proceeding from Unity. They explain that thought by the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of three Pleats, or folds in an Handkerchief, which may be called three, though it be but one piece of cloth when it is unfolded. Theſe are no great Admirers of the <hi>Alchoran,</hi> they only make uſe of that which they find agrees with their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and reject the reſt, as if it were aboliſht. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, that the chief Good of man conſiſts in the Contemplation of the Majeſty of God; they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe the dreams and groſs imaginations of <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met,</hi> concerning the Pleaſures of Paradiſe. All the <hi>Schecs,</hi> and the moſt able Preachers of the Royal <hi>Moſques,</hi> are of this Sect. They are very diligent in their devotions, and ſober in their dyet, &amp;c. They have alſo a great deal of Charity for their Neighbours, ſaying, they are the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of God, &amp;c. They inſtruct their Scholars to be moderate, wiſe and grave, in a word to abſtain from all evil Actions, and to practiſe all Vertues.</q> One ſtep farther, and theſe People will be much better <hi>Chriſtians</hi> than the <hi>Greeks,</hi> who have the name and Profeſſion of Chriſtians.</p>

               <note place="margin">A general diſpoſition in the world to deſpiſe and forſake Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery.</note>5. The ſenſible <hi>Fall</hi> and declenſion <hi>of the Papacy,</hi> is a <hi>fifth ſign</hi> of that great work which God is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king way for. It ſeems to be furious, to reign, and get ground; nevertheleſs, in truth it is falling; for as God diſcredited the <hi>Religion</hi> of the <hi>Pagan Idols,</hi> a little before the coming of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt; ſo he makes this renewed Paganiſm of <hi>Popery,</hi> to be in leſs credit and eſteem than formerly. <hi>Men</hi> begin
<pb facs="tcp:95320:9"/>to diſguſt the <hi>popish ſuperſtitions.</hi> They ſpeak of the <hi>Invocation of Saints</hi> with contempt; and boldly condemn the exceſs of it, and call it <hi>Idolatry,</hi> when they ſpeak of it in private. They wiſh <hi>Images</hi> were baniſht from their <hi>Churches,</hi> that it might not be a ſcandal and an offence to us: They begin to confeſs, that there was no neceſſity for the taking away the <hi>Cup.</hi> They acknowledge, that a man may be ſaved <hi>without Indulgencies,</hi> by the ſole merit of <hi>I.

Since it is freely confeſt, that the <hi>adoration</hi> of one <hi>God</hi> is ſufficient without that of <hi>Saints</hi> and <hi>Images,</hi> they muſt ſhortly conclude, that for things unneceſſary they ought not to ſcandalize one half of the Chriſtian World, and ſhut the Gate againſt the <hi>Iews</hi> and the <hi>Mahometans.</hi> Never were there ſo many in the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> as now, who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the vanity &amp; impurity of their <hi>Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi> Every man hath the liberty of his own thoughts; but I profeſs, that to me theſe are great preſages of the approach of the <hi>laſt</hi> work of God, for the eſtabliſhment of his <hi>Kingdom,</hi> and the ruin of that of <hi>Antichriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My ſpirit was in this frame, when this laſt and great <hi>Perſecution</hi> in <hi>France</hi> began. I therein took notice of ſeveral <hi>Characters,</hi> that confirmed me in
<pb facs="tcp:95320:9"/>the belief that we were in the <hi>laſt times</hi> of the Period of 1260 <hi>years,</hi> and that this is the laſt <hi>Perſecution</hi> ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of in the 11th <hi>Chap. Revel.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Singular Characters in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage that it shall be this laſt.</note>

And their dead Bodies shall lye in the ſtreet of the great City three days and a half.</hi> For there are ſo many things <hi>ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar</hi> and <hi>irregular</hi> in this <hi>Perſecution,</hi> that without prophaneſs and a denial of Divine Providence, we cannot but acknowledge the hand of God therein. 'Tis ſingular and more than uſual, whether we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the <hi>Authors</hi> of this Perſecution, and the <hi>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi> of it; or whether we conſider the <hi>Subjects</hi> that ſuffer it, and in what manner they <hi>ſuffer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to the <hi>Perſecutors</hi> themſelves, There is <hi>Firſt</hi> a <hi>Prince,</hi> who hath the chiefeſt obligation to us for the <hi>Crown</hi> he wears, which entred into his Family by the perſon of his Grand Father; <hi>a Prince,</hi> to whom we have always paid obedience and ſubmiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, without the leaſt ſhadow of Rebellion: <hi>a Prince</hi> for whom we preſerved the <hi>Crown</hi> in his <hi>minority,</hi> and who hath not ſcrupled to teſtify that we did ſo: <hi>a Prince,</hi> who is wiſe and underſtanding, as to his own <hi>Intereſts,</hi> and thoſe of the <hi>States of Europe,</hi> who yet in deſpite of his own <hi>Intereſt,</hi> hath done all that which the <hi>Houſe of Auſtria</hi> would have dictated to him to do if ſhe had imployed her <hi>Emiſſaries</hi> in his <hi>Council:</hi> who deſtroys his own Subjects, who makes innumerable Male-contents, who throws eternal ſeeds of rebellion and war in his own Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, who diſobliges his <hi>Proteſtant Allies,</hi> and alienates them in ſuch a manner almoſt as never to be reconciled. The <hi>Proteſtant States</hi> and <hi>Princes</hi> have been always the principal <hi>Allies</hi> of <hi>France, Swede, Denmark, England,</hi> the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> the

               <hi>Switzers,</hi> and the <hi>Proteſtant Princes</hi> of <hi>Germany.</hi> Theſe are they that have ſupported it, when the <hi>Houſe of Auſtria</hi> threatned the liberty of all <hi>Europe.</hi> And theſe are they who aſſiſted <hi>France,</hi> to humble the <hi>Houſe of Auſtria</hi> ſo low as now it is, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently that have advanced <hi>France</hi> to that point of Grandeur ſhe is now at. But Time will ſhew how great a wound <hi>France</hi> hath now made in the heart of all her ancient <hi>Allies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We ſee already that <hi>this Perſecution</hi> makes the diſcord and diſſention ceaſe that was between the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> and brings them nearer an union and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation than before. God will let us ſee ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing farther of that kind. However, it muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, that there is ſomething therein, which is not to be underſtood by man, that ſo wiſe <hi>a Court</hi> ſhould violate all the <hi>rules</hi> of good policy, which is the Soul of <hi>States,</hi> and the ſpring of all their motions.</p>
            <p>If we look upon the <hi>Clergy,</hi> that ſeems to have been the <hi>Sollicitor</hi> of this <hi>Perſecution,</hi> it will appear no leſs extraordinary. 'Tis not an Ignorant and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious <hi>Clergy,</hi> as was that of the laſt <hi>Century.</hi> Theſe are underſtanding and knowing perſons, Men of learning and prudence, freed from the ridiculous affectation, and prejudice of a <hi>Monaſtic Spirit,</hi> who have little zeal for the <hi>Romish Ceremonies:</hi> who flight their <hi>worship,</hi> at leaſt for the moſt part of it; who have much <hi>knowledge of the Truth,</hi> and at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom but very <hi>little Religion.</hi> In a word, they are ſuch, as know very well that <hi>we</hi> are not in the wrong, or at leaſt, that altogether and in every thing <hi>we</hi> are not: Nevertheleſs, they <hi>perſecute us</hi> more cruelly, than the moſt furious <hi>Monks,</hi> or inraged <hi>Inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors</hi> have ever done.

They <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve</hi> a multitude of wretched People, who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt that by meer force and violence, they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to <hi>ſign</hi> the abjuration of their <hi>Religion,</hi> and to get out of the hands of a thouſand Executioners, who devour'd and deſtroyed 'em, and gave them no reſt day or night. The <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Bishops</hi> who ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved them, know well enough that they are Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent and Heretiques, and perſevering in their <hi>Hereſy;</hi> nevertheleſs, they give them abſolution. Moreover, they bring them to their <hi>Altars</hi> by force and violence; they muſt be <hi>confeſt;</hi> they muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire the <hi>Sacraments,</hi> and they are given them. In the mean time, they know, that they deteſt and abhor from their very hearts, as a meer <hi>Idol,</hi> that which is given them to eat and worſhip as a <hi>God.</hi> So that all theſe are <hi>Sacrilegious Communions,</hi> and in plain terms, the moſt abominable Sacriledge that can be
<pb facs="tcp:95320:11"/>imagined: what conſcience can we ſuppoſe theſe <hi>men</hi> to have, who are guilty of ſuch abominations, ſo directly contrary to their own Principles?</p>
            <p>But by what name ſhall we call <hi>the Oath,</hi> which they force men to take, and which they have pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly printed; in which <hi>the new Converts ſwear by the name of God, and upon the H. Evangeliſts, that they have willingly abjured, and without conſtraint or force?</hi> And yet the <hi>Bishops</hi> know, and all the World is acquainted with it, that they have been forc't to this <hi>abjuration,</hi> by armies of <hi>Butchers</hi> and <hi>Executioners,</hi> let looſe upon them. Where are any principles of Morality, even thoſe of the greateſt latitude, that will permit this? can there be any more horrible prophanation of an <hi>Oath?</hi> than which nothing is more ſacred and venerable.</p>
            <p>In what a ſtate muſt ſuch mens Conſciences needs be, who force theſe poor men to commit ſo execrable a <hi>perjury,</hi> and cauſe the name of <hi>God</hi> to be uſed, for the aſſuring the <hi>Truth</hi> of a Thing, which is moſt notoriouſly <hi>falſe?</hi> I confeſs, I ſhall never comprehend this; and will alway ſay, there is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in it more than humane, that <hi>Men</hi> ſhould make profeſſion of a <hi>Religion,</hi> and contradict the moſt inviolable rules of it, openly before all the World. But to what a pitch of <hi>Impudence</hi> muſt they be arrived, who Print and publiſh, that no violence at all hath been imployed to make theſe Converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? All <hi>France</hi> abounds with ſtrangers, who are witneſſes of it; the <hi>Miniſters</hi> of the <hi>Princes of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope</hi> behold in; forreign <hi>Merchants</hi> ſee and know it; An hundred thouſand <hi>witneſſes,</hi> who have them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves <hi>eſcapt</hi> out of the hands of theſe <hi>Executioners,</hi> carry tidings of it to all the ends of the <hi>Earth;</hi> and yet there are ſome who have the confidence to deny a matter of Fact, that was done in the ſight of all <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope.</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:95320:11"/>We read the <hi>Arreſts;</hi> we ſee the <hi>Ordonnanees</hi> of the <hi>Intendants;</hi> we ſee <hi>Woods</hi> cut down, and <hi>Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> raſed; we behold <hi>twelve</hi> or <hi>fifteen thouſand Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners</hi> in all the Priſons of the <hi>Kingdom:</hi> and yet they tell us, <hi>there is no ſuch thing as Perſecution.</hi> This is one thing which is very ſingular in this Perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and which hath no example. I could not read without trembling, what Mr. <hi>de Brueys</hi> ſaith in his laſt piece, <hi>that the ſucceſs there hath been of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods imployed for the Converſion of the Reformed, make it evident that they were altogether diſpoſed to receive the Catholick Truth.</hi> I know not what thoſe diſpoſitions were as to himſelf: but I queſtion not but by the ſame means to make him turn <hi>Turk,</hi> and afterwards <hi>Heathen,</hi> in a very little time.</p>
            <p>What Judgement can one make of ſuch men as Mr. <hi>Brueys,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Maimbourg,</hi> who in the Epiſtle Dedicatory to the Life of <hi>Gregory</hi> I. complements and congratulates the <hi>King</hi> to this purpoſe, <hi>that he ſees the Period of</hi> Calviniſm, <hi>without having made uſe of any means to bring it about, but thoſe of Grace and ſweetneſs, mild and gentle methods?</hi> 'Tis theſe kind and gracious proceedings that hath forc't <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi> of good birth and quality, accuſtomed to all the beſt accommodations of Life, to leave <hi>ten, twenty, thirty, forty</hi> thouſand <hi>Livres per annum,</hi> to expoſe themſelves to all ſorts of ſuffering and diſgrace. 'Tis theſe ſweet and obliging ways, that hath forc't <hi>wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> of every age &amp; quality to come away, diſguis'd in the habit of <hi>Peaſants,</hi> ſome on <hi>foot,</hi> ſome on <hi>horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back,</hi> ſome by <hi>Poſt,</hi> ſome who were eight or nine <hi>moneths</hi> with child, in the night, through all the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigues of the <hi>winter.</hi> I ſay once more, that I cannot underſtand, how <hi>men</hi> that have any honour to loſe, or at leaſt, who believe they have, can declare that to be <hi>falſe,</hi> which is ſo evident and notorious, that
<pb facs="tcp:95320:12"/>nothing is more publickly <hi>known,</hi> or more <hi>undeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</hi> This is a ſort of <hi>Lying</hi> that in my opinion is very perticular. But it the mean while, 'tis an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage paid to <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Juſtice;</hi> 'tis a confeſſion, that ſuch Actions are moſt black and abominable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe though they are committed in the face of the Sun, they dare not own them; they deny them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thoſe who were eye-witneſſes of them. No man of honour, after the reading of Mr. <hi>Maimbourg's</hi> Epiſtle to the <hi>King,</hi> prefixt to the Life of <hi>St. Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory,</hi> but muſt judge him to be one of the moſt baſe and diſhoneſt <hi>Writers</hi> in the world. It had been more pardonable, if he had only by the by dropt ſuch a falſehood, without inſiſting on it. But to write a large <hi>Epiſtle Dedicatory</hi> on that ſubject, to comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the <hi>King</hi> for the <hi>Converſions</hi> he hath made, without uſing any other means than <hi>ſweetneſs</hi> and <hi>Charity,</hi> this is to put the moſt patient <hi>Readers</hi> out of all patience.</p>
            <p>If we conſider the <hi>manner</hi> of this <hi>perſecution,</hi> it is no leſs extraordinary; 'Tis new, 'tis without exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. 'Tis no new thing to condemn <hi>people</hi> to dye, or, to offer incenſe to <hi>Idols,</hi> and to go to <hi>Maſs,</hi> to ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh <hi>Chriſtians</hi> or maſſacre them, becauſe they will not joyn in with the <hi>Religion</hi> that is uppermoſt; this hath been ſeen an hundred times. But I maintain, there was never any thing ſeen like <hi>this Perſecution,</hi> which we ſee at <hi>preſent.</hi> They tell People, they will not <hi>kill</hi> them; on the contrary, <q>
                  <hi>we will,</hi> ſay they, that you live, but you ſhall go to Maſs, or you ſhall be tortured; you ſhall be confined within the Kingdom; you ſhall not be ſuffered to go away; if you attempt an eſcape, you ſhall be ſent to the Gallies; while you ſtay, you ſhall have fifty Soldiers, or rather Executioners to maintain; if fifty be not ſufficient, you ſhall have an hundred,
<pb facs="tcp:95320:12"/>with expreſs orders, not to let you alone by day or night to omit no pillage, no blows, no puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, no torments, till you have renounc't your Religion.</q> This, I ſay, is what hath never been ſeen before.</p>
            <p>The ſucceſs hath made many believe, that this infernal method was the moſt happily invented by the <hi>Clergy,</hi> that could be, to promote the deſign of the <hi>Converters,</hi> and to ruin the <hi>Reformation.</hi> But I am quite of another opinion; and 'tis one of the moſt extraordinary things which I find in this <hi>perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> that any perſons of good ſenſe, ſhould believe this to be a likely method to aboliſh a <hi>Religion.</hi> The <hi>perſecution</hi> was well enough begun, in order to the <hi>end</hi> and <hi>deſign</hi> of the Perſecutors. And had they been contented by little and little to deprive us of our <hi>Temples,</hi> to baniſh our <hi>Miniſters,</hi> to forbid all <hi>Aſſemblies,</hi> to leave us in <hi>ignorance,</hi> and deprive us of all the other advantages which others Subjects injoy; the <hi>Reformed Religion</hi> would have been almoſt <hi>extinguisht</hi> before <hi>ten years</hi> were over: ſuch being the coldneſs and declenſion of <hi>Piety,</hi> to which the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> were already come. But <hi>God,</hi> who would not that his <hi>Truth</hi> ſhould periſh, ſuffer'd not that things ſhould remain in that poſture. 'Tis well known, that humane paſſions are a great help to Chriſtian vertues; The <hi>fury</hi> which theſe <hi>perſons</hi> are now in, who feel this violence, the <hi>torment</hi> they ſuffer in their Conſciences, the <hi>rage</hi> which they are in, for being forced; do all concur to fortify the <hi>hatred</hi> they had of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> and their <hi>love</hi> and incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation for the <hi>Truth.</hi> So that by means of theſe vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Paſſions, the <hi>Truth</hi> makes the more indelible impreſſions on their hearts. He muſt be very igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant in the <hi>Hiſtory</hi> of the World, and of the <hi>Heart</hi> of man, who can think this to be a likely way to extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh
<pb facs="tcp:95320:13"/>a <hi>Religion.</hi> The means to extirpate an <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy,</hi> pretended, or real, is to cut off the <hi>Heads,</hi> to ſhed a great deal of blood, and to ſtifle the moſt zealous of them by a <hi>maſſacre:</hi> for if you ſuffer them to live, and are content only to draw from them a feigned abjuration, you thereby make them <hi>irreconcileable Hereticks.</hi> 'Twas by fire and ſword the <hi>Albigenſes</hi> were deſtroyed. There is yet another very effectual way of extinguiſhing an <hi>Hereſy,</hi> which is to take away from them all means of increaſe and growth by preaching and inſtruction: after this manner the <hi>Arrian Hereſy</hi> was ſuppreſt by the <hi>Emperors.</hi> This way they began to take in <hi>France</hi> for theſe <hi>twenty years</hi> laſt paſt, and which could not have failed of ſucceſs, as I obſerved, if it had been continued. But he muſt be very blind that can believe, that <hi>Perſons,</hi> into whoſe Heads and Hearts you would force the <hi>Truth</hi> by blows and violence, will not recover themſelves again aſſoon as poſſible, and by all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ways. But it will be ſaid, there are other me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods uſed, which you grant to be effectual; <hi>The People are deprived of all the means of Inſtruction, and ſo in a little time the Truth muſt dye.</hi> This would prove ſo, if their Conſciences were not under ſuch a violence as they are; and if that poſture of things could laſt long, the <hi>Truth</hi> would then be extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſht by little and little. But that ſtate of things is too violent to continue long; and within a <hi>few years</hi> you will ſee the <hi>Light</hi> of that <hi>fire,</hi> which is ſhut up, without being extinguiſht.</p>
            <p>There is another thing very extraordinary in <hi>this Perſecution,</hi> and wherein the finger of God doth manifeſtly appear; that is, the way they have taken in their dealing with the <hi>Paſtors.</hi> Theſe are the <hi>men</hi> that muſt be ſuppreſt, if you would extinguiſh a <hi>Religion:</hi> becauſe they are capable of recovering
<pb facs="tcp:95320:13"/>it. Therefore in all former <hi>Ages</hi> the ſevereſt part of the ſtorm hath fallen on them; and even in this Age likewiſe, witneſs the <hi>Hiſtory</hi> of the Perſecutions in <hi>Hungary.</hi> But here is the quite contrary, the <hi>People</hi> ruined, and the <hi>Miniſters</hi> ſuffered to go free. They muſt carry nothing away with them, but their Souls and Conſciences are given them as a prey: which ſo many <hi>Laiks</hi> would deſire and rejoyce to obtain. Theſe <hi>banished Paſtors</hi> carry the account of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries of their ſeveral <hi>Flocks</hi> into all parts of the World. They are in all the <hi>Proteſtant Courts of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi> the unreproveable <hi>Witneſſes</hi> of the violence of the <hi>Perſecution:</hi> their miſeries ſtir up compaſſion towards the afflicted, and Indignation againſt their <hi>Perſecutors.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Beſides this, they are always ready, and kept in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, to return into <hi>France,</hi> and bring back the Light of Truth again <hi>there,</hi> whenever God ſhall pleaſe to open the door. This is ſuch a thing as ſpeaks plainly, that God preſerves them in ſafety, in order to his great work, and till then. This is <hi>not</hi> the effect of the <hi>Compaſſion</hi> of their <hi>Perſecutors;</hi> for they are deſtitute of any, and are cruel to the utmoſt degree. 'Tis not a piece of <hi>policy</hi> neither; for that would have made them ſecure the <hi>Paſtors</hi> in ſuch a place, wherein they ſhould have been condemned to an eternal ſilence. 'Tis then a ſecret Providence of God, which leads perſons farther than they would go, and to do that which they would not have other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe done: and 'tis obſervable, that Biſhop <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>sher</hi> in his <hi>prophecy</hi> doth expreſly take notice of this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, that <hi>in this laſt perſecution the Paſtors shall be ſpared, God reſerving them for the Great work he hath farther to do;</hi> which makes me give the more heed to that <hi>prophecy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly,</hi> that we may ſee how extraordinary <hi>this
<pb facs="tcp:95320:14"/>perſecution</hi> is in all its Circumſtances, let us conſider it in its <hi>ſucceſs,</hi> and with reſpect to thoſe on whom it hath ſucceeded. I look upon that <hi>general Deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> an whole <hi>Kingdom</hi> in a manner changing its <hi>Religion</hi> in <hi>four moneths</hi> time, as a thing that cannot be parallel'd. 'Tis true, the <hi>Roman Empire</hi> hath been ſeen to become <hi>Arrian</hi> in a very little while, by the perſecution of the <hi>Emperors.</hi> But <hi>Arrianiſm</hi> was a ſpeculative <hi>Hereſy,</hi> and the <hi>Arrians</hi> cheated the People by <hi>equivocal</hi> Confeſſions of Faith, which taken in good ſenſe, might now be ſubſcribed unto. And for other things, their <hi>Worship, Prayers, Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, Altars, Bishops, Government,</hi> 'twas all alike; and ſo the paſſage from one to another was very eaſy. But here is the greateſt <hi>difference</hi> imaginable, in worſhip, the object of adoration, the manner of it, in Ceremonies, Government, and Diſcipline. The <hi>Reformed Religion</hi> and the <hi>Roman</hi> differ as Day and Night; ſo that there muſt have been a prodigious Current, for the paſſage from one to another in ſo little time. 'Tis a frightfull and ſurprizing thing to ſee People make leſs difficulty to change their <hi>God,</hi> than good Subjects would do to change <hi>their Prince;</hi> in caſe an Enemy break into any Country, he would not find People ſo ready to abjure their former Oath of Fidelity. 'Tis true, this <hi>kind</hi> of <hi>perſecution,</hi> which is made uſe of againſt the <hi>reformed,</hi> ſeems to me more <hi>cruel</hi> and more likely to overcome their conſtancy, then <hi>Maſſacres,</hi> and <hi>Fires, Wheels,</hi> and <hi>Gibbets.</hi> When a man can ſee to the end of his ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, though that end be death, he may be able to ſtand his ground: but when he is given over to an hundred Executioners, who are commiſſioned to torment him by turns, without giving him the leaſt repoſe, I confeſs, this is the ready way to deſpair. If they did nothing more than hinder a man from ſleep,
<pb facs="tcp:95320:14"/>it were ſufficient to make him diſtracted, and to make him do what ever they would have him. 'Tis certain then, that ſeveral of thoſe who have yielded, would more willingly have ſuffer'd death for their Religion, and have earneſtly and ſeriouſly deſired it. But what is very ſtrange, is that the greateſt part have not tarried for theſe <hi>Perſecutors.</hi> At the very approach of the <hi>Dragoons</hi> they cowardly complied, and a ſmall number of True Believets remain'd vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctims, expoſed to the Rage of an <hi>Army</hi> of an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſand men, which were let looſe upon the <hi>Kingdom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This, I ſay again, is without Example in any <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtsry. S. Cyprian</hi> in his Treatiſe <hi>de Lapſis,</hi> ſeems to ſay that ſome ſuch thing happened in the perſecution of <hi>Decius;</hi> but he himſelf in his <hi>Epiſtles</hi> makes it evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that the <hi>Apoſtacy</hi> was not ſo general: for he remits thoſe who had fallen to be judged at the return of Peace, in the Aſſemblics of the Faithful who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevered; ſo that the number of thoſe that perſevered muſt have been conſiderable. In our time it would be difficult out of every Flock to make up an <hi>Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly</hi> of ſuch as perſevere to judge the reſt. 'Tis there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore an Event, wherein we muſt admire the depth of Divine Providence. 'Tis a ſpeaking Prodigy, which tells us, we are now in thoſe laſt days, when Chriſt ſhould come, and not find true Piety, or true Faith upon Earth. This is a Touch-ſtone for all <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants;</hi> their Brethren of <hi>France</hi> were not more wicked than others: Wherefore we may believe, that the ſame thing would happen in any other place, on ſuppoſition of the ſame Circumſtances; and conſequently, that Chriſtian courage and true Faith are at this day very rare, and few Inſtances to be found. <hi>Laſtly,</hi> this Affair tells us, that God would melt the Heart of that People, and ſuffer
<pb facs="tcp:95320:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>them to ſink and be ſwallowed up, that he may ſhortly raiſe to himſelf another, a new People. Theſe are the <hi>Characters</hi> of this <hi>perſecution,</hi> which makes me regard it as very ſingular and extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in its kind, and conſequently as a preſage, that God will ſhortly finiſh the eſtabliſhment of his <hi>Kingdom,</hi> and the <hi>Ruin</hi> of that of <hi>Antichriſt.</hi> If we only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, how this <hi>Perſecution</hi> hath been more effectual than any the <hi>Church</hi> ever ſuffer'd, it were enough to make us judge, that the <hi>Devil</hi> now imploys his ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt force and power, as apprehending 'tis the laſt Time, and that the ruin of his <hi>Kingdom</hi> is at hand. When <hi>Paganiſm</hi> was ready to fall under <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> he then excited the ſharpeſt <hi>perſecution</hi> under the Emperor <hi>Diocleſian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe are the different Reflexions that conſpired to poſſeſs me, that the coming of our Lord was near, to <hi>deſtroy the wicked one by the Breath of his Mouth.</hi> I had a ſtrong inclination to be certain and aſſured of the truth of theſe Thoughts, which could no otherwiſe be done but by finding in the <hi>Apocalypſe,</hi> the accompliſhment of thoſe <hi>Circumſtances,</hi> which were to precede and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany the fall of the <hi>Babylonish Empire.</hi> With this deſign I betook my ſelf to read over the <hi>Apocalipſe,</hi> not the ſeveral Commentators on that Book, but the Book it ſelf, only with the Expoſition of <hi>Ioſeph Mede,</hi> whom I formerly look't upon as a man in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired for the Interpretation of the <hi>Prophecies.</hi> His <hi>Key of the Apocalypſe,</hi> and annexed commentary, did heretofore charm me. I could find nothing like it in all the other Expoſitors. I added that of his <hi>Chronicles,</hi> and his Book called <hi>The Apoſtacy of the latter Times,</hi> which is a large Commentary on 1 <hi>Tim. Chap.</hi> 4. <hi>v.</hi> 1, 2, 3, 4. <hi>And the Spirit ſaith ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly, that in the laſt times there shall be ſome who
<pb facs="tcp:95320:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>shall depart from the Faith.</hi> Beſides ſeveral excellent and curious things, (a part whereof you will find in this Treatiſe) I met with in that Author the thing which I ſo eagerly ſought for, <hi>viz.</hi> the true <hi>Epocha</hi> of the 1260 <hi>years,</hi> during which Time the <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian Empire</hi> ſhould laſt; he makes them to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin about the <hi>year</hi> of our Lord 450. or 455. by dateing them from thence, they muſt end about the year 1710, or 1715. which agrees very well with my conjecture. But <hi>Ioſeph Mede,</hi> who ſet me right at firſt in the beginning of the true path, forſook me in the middle of the way; and when the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances and preliminaries of the <hi>fall of Babylon</hi> were to be adjuſted according to this Calculation, which are ſo exactly deſcribed in the <hi>Apocalypſe,</hi> I found no aſſiſtance at all from him; on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, he led me out of the way, wherin he himſelf had put me, and to make me wander and go aſtray. According to the <hi>Epocha</hi> which he himſelf had mark't, for the beginning of the 1260 <hi>years</hi> for the reign of <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> I ſhould ſee the end of it in 25 or 30 <hi>years,</hi> but according to <hi>Mr. Mede</hi> there muſt be many Ages to accompliſh all things which are to be fulfilled before the period of the <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Antichriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the 11<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, 14<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, &amp; 16<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, Chapters, we have an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Circumſtances and degrees of the <hi>Fall</hi> of that <hi>Empire;</hi> the <hi>Eleventh</hi> Chapter ſpeaks of the <hi>death</hi> of the <hi>two Witneſſes</hi> for three days and half, of their <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> and of the <hi>fall</hi> of the tenth part of the <hi>City,</hi> &amp;c. In the 14, Chap. where the <hi>Fall of Babylon</hi> is divided into two Acts, one is called the <hi>Vintage,</hi> the other the <hi>Harveſt.</hi> In the 16<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. Chap. where the <hi>ſeven Periods</hi> of the declen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and Fall of the <hi>Antichriſtian Empire,</hi> are ſet forth by <hi>ſeven</hi> viols and <hi>ſeven</hi> Plagues; of all this
<pb facs="tcp:95320:16"/>
               <hi>Ioſeph Mede</hi> underſtood nothing; yea, ſuppoſing, as he doth, that of thoſe <hi>ſeven Plagues</hi> not above <hi>two or three</hi> were come to paſs in his Time, he remits us far enough off for the accompliſhment of the <hi>five</hi> others. The <hi>Periods</hi> deſcribed by every <hi>Viol</hi> are each of them more than one Age: ſo that we ſhould have four or five hundred <hi>years</hi> yet to come, before the end of the <hi>Kingdom of Antichriſt.</hi> If every one of the <hi>four</hi> viols, that remain to be poured out, were but of fifty <hi>years,</hi> we ſhould have yet two hundred <hi>years</hi> longer to wait.</p>
            <p>I confeſs, that after having <hi>read</hi> thoſe places of the <hi>Apocalypſe,</hi> and reviewed them twenty times, I underſtood nothing more therin; I was only more and more confirmed, that no man had rightly underſtood them. In the midſt of theſe diſtractions I yet begun my work, without knowing well where I went. But I can ſay, that God ſo opened mine eyes in the way, that gave me unexpreſſible conſolation; for after having conſulted the <hi>Eternal Truth</hi> above an hundred times, with a deep Humility, and very great Attention, at length I received an anſwer, at leaſt I believe ſo, and think it very plain, that <hi>all that muſt precede the laſt Fall of the Antichriſtian Empire, is fully ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſht.</hi> I have no right to require the ſame aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance from others, neither do I require it. But that which I demand at leaſt, is a little of that <hi>attention,</hi> which I imployed in the meditation of thoſe divine <hi>Oracles,</hi> and then I am perſwaded, that if you are not as fully convinc'd as I am, you will yet ſee reaſon enough not to condemn me of raſhneſs.</p>
            <p>In the firſt part of this work, you will find nothing new for the ſubſtance of it; for 'tis a long time that <hi>Rome</hi> hath been called <hi>Babylon,</hi> and that the <hi>Characters</hi> of the <hi>Antichriſtian Empire</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:95320:16"/>have been confeſt to be found in the <hi>Papacy.</hi> I believe nevertheleſs, that you will find that <hi>Truth</hi> better cleared, and made more manifeſt, than hitherto it hath been. This Controverſie about <hi>Antichriſt</hi> hath languiſht for an hundred <hi>years;</hi> it hath been unhappily abandon'd, on a politick account, and in obedience to <hi>Popiſh Princes.</hi> 'Tis a wicked Complaiſance, for which we are puniſht, and which hath coſt us very dear: for if we had perpetually expoſed this Great and important <hi>Truth</hi> before the Eyes of the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> that the <hi>Papacy is Antichriſtianiſm,</hi> they would not have fallen into that degeneracy and apoſtacy, which we ſee at preſent. How could they have reſolved within themſelves to ſubmit to <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> and return to his Party! But 'tis ſo long ſince they heard it ſo called, that they have forgot it. They thought it was only a tranſport of zeal in the <hi>firſt Reformers,</hi> from which we were now come off. There was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in that neglect and forgetfullneſs, which ſeems to diſcover the finger of God: He would that this horrible cataſtrophe ſhould happen, and to that end permitted that this important <hi>Truth</hi> ſhould be neglected, and thoſe controverſies only which were but acceſſory ſhould be minded, and that this ſhould be paſſ't over, <hi>that the Papacy is the Antichriſtian Empire:</hi> they who for want of giving heed to that Truth are fallen, ought now to think of it, and tremble to conſider, that they have voluntarily plung'd themſelves again into that <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon,</hi> out of which God had ſo wonderfully delivered them. In my opinion, this is ſo fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal a <hi>Truth,</hi> that without it a man cannot be a true <hi>Chriſtian:</hi> to confound the Kingdom of <hi>J. Chriſt</hi> with that of <hi>Antichriſt</hi> is an unſufferable Fault: in ſome Ages for certain God hath permitted that
<pb facs="tcp:95320:17"/>Ignorance; but we are not now in thoſe times: we muſt now declare for one party, and ſtand our ground. There is no Communion between <hi>Chriſt</hi> and <hi>Belial,</hi> between the Prince of <hi>light,</hi> and that <hi>Deſtroyer,</hi> who is truly an Angel of <hi>Darkneſs;</hi> that <hi>Controverſy</hi> was ſo much ſtifled and laid aſleep, that our Adverſaries believed it dead, and thought that we had renounc't that <hi>Principle,</hi> and the ground of all our <hi>Reformation;</hi> for I cannot believe the <hi>Reformation</hi> to have been on a good foundation, but on this account. Some <hi>Proteſtants</hi> (the reproach and ſhame not only of the <hi>Reformation</hi> but of the Chriſtian name) have contributed to efface theſe Ideas from the minds of men, by turning to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſenſe what the H. Ghoſt ſaith of the <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian Empire,</hi> making ſuch Commentaries of the ſcripture, as overthrow the deſign and meaning of it, forging Hiſtories at pleaſure, by that means to find the accompliſhment of <hi>S. Iohn's Prophecies</hi> in the firſt ages of the <hi>Church.</hi> At preſent therfore we muſt revive that <hi>Truth,</hi> which we had almoſt ſuffered to dye. This is the Time when we muſt indeavour to open the Eyes of the <hi>Princes</hi> and <hi>People</hi> of the Earth; for behold <hi>now</hi> is the Time when they ought to eat the fleſh of the Beaſt, and burn it with fire, ſtrip naked the whore, and tear off her ornaments, and make a full end of <hi>Babylon.</hi> Within a little while theſe great Things muſt come to paſs; 'tis high time then to awaken <hi>men</hi> in order to it. This is what I attempt in the firſt part of this work, wherein I diſcover, after another manner than hath been done hitherto, the <hi>true</hi> Characters of that <hi>Antichriſtian Empire.</hi> In which I muſt acknowledg my great obligations to my foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned Author, <hi>Joſeph Mede;</hi> for no man hath taken pains upon that ſubject with ſo much ſucceſs as he<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb facs="tcp:95320:17"/>You will ſee the admirable <hi>Type</hi> of <hi>Antichriſt</hi> in the famous <hi>Antiochus,</hi> carried farther than ever it hath been, and the explication of the <hi>three years and half,</hi> or 1260 <hi>days,</hi> much clearer than ever hitherto it hath been made. But I muſt here ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſe, that to comprehend the full force of my Arguments, to prove the <hi>Papacy</hi> to be the <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian Empire,</hi> to the reading of this work, you muſt add that of my <hi>Lawful Prejudices againſt Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;</hi> for in that book you will find the proof of all the Characters of the <hi>Antichriſtian Empire</hi> inlarged. I mean not only thoſe <hi>Chapters,</hi> wherein the explication of ſome paſſages in the Prophecies concerning <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> I apply them to the <hi>Pope</hi> and his Empire, I ſpeak principally of thoſe <hi>Chapters</hi> where I deſcribe the <hi>Corruption, Covetouſneſs, Pride, Idolatry, Paganiſm,</hi> the fabulous and lying <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Popery,</hi> all characters of <hi>Antichriſtianiſm,</hi> as in this work is ſhown. I deſire all thoſe who have any care of their ſalvation to <hi>Read</hi> thoſe <hi>two pieces,</hi> and I dare be confident that all thoſe who have not a ſeared Conſcience will be ſenſibly affected with what they ſhall there find, and conceive a juſt <hi>Horror</hi> for that <hi>Religion,</hi> which hath held the <hi>Truth</hi> under ſo long and cruel a Captivity. That I may render my <hi>Lawfull Prejudices</hi> the more uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to my deſign, which is to make the <hi>Papacy</hi> appear to be the true <hi>Antichriſtianiſm,</hi> I am re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, according to the advice that hath been given me, to <hi>abridge</hi> it; but inſtead of making a pure and ſimple abridgment, I ſhall, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting it, change the <hi>Prejudices</hi> into ſo many <hi>Characters</hi> of <hi>Antichriſtianiſm:</hi> and ſhow, that there is no one of thoſe <hi>Prejudices</hi> but is a character of the <hi>Antichriſtian Empire.</hi> If any thing retards this deſign, it will be my deſire to ſee whether <hi>Mr.
<pb facs="tcp:95320:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>Arnaud</hi> will make good the promiſe of <hi>F. Simon,</hi> and reply to that <hi>Book.</hi> So that when I <hi>Abridge</hi> that <hi>Book,</hi> I may at the ſame time refute the Sophiſms <hi>Mr. Arnaud</hi> is preparing. <hi>This firſt part regards the Time paſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>ſecond part</hi> contains the explication of <hi>Things Future,</hi> or rather of thoſe which we <hi>believe</hi> are yet to come, there are many things therin which will certainly be ſurprizing to you, as they were to me; and if you read with any favourable opinion, what I ſay upon the 11<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, 14<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, and 16<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. <hi>Chapters</hi> of the <hi>Apocalyps,</hi> I cannot believe you will have much different <hi>Thoughts</hi> from mine. I will not call them <hi>Conjectures,</hi> let them be ſuch to others, I conſent; but as to <hi>me,</hi> there is ſomething more; for I think I have diſcovered which are the <hi>two</hi> parts of the <hi>Fall</hi> of <hi>Babylon,</hi> whereof one is called the <hi>Harveſt,</hi> the other the <hi>Vintage.</hi> I believe that I have found the <hi>ſeven viols</hi> of the 16<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. Chap. to be <hi>already</hi> poured out, which were ſuppoſed to be yet to come, which to me is an argument, that the <hi>Reign</hi> of <hi>Antichriſt</hi> is near its end. I know not whether others have diſcovered any thing of this before me; I pretend not to have peruſed all the <hi>Modern</hi> Commentators on the <hi>Apocalyps;</hi> on the Contrary I have read very few of them, having experienc't, that the diverſity of <hi>Ideas</hi> that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in the mind, ſerve but to obſcure the <hi>Truth,</hi> and cauſe one to loſe it. <hi>Some</hi> I conſulted before I made this <hi>ſecond Ediction;</hi> but I found nothing ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable to make me alter my ſentiments, or that could furniſh me with any new light. <hi>Dr. Moore</hi> is one of the lateſt Commentators on the <hi>Apocalypſe,</hi> and one of the moſt eſteemed. I found, that he follows <hi>Mede</hi> in every thing, ſave in the explication of the <hi>Harveſt</hi> and the <hi>Vintage,</hi> of the 14<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. Chap.
<pb facs="tcp:95320:18"/>the <hi>ſeven viols</hi> of the 16<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, and the <hi>death</hi> of the <hi>two Witneſſes</hi> of the 11<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. Chap. that is, that he had followed him in thoſe places, wherein he had ſucceeded well: 'tis in effect impoſſible to differ from him in thoſe places. But in thoſe places where <hi>Mr. Mede</hi> was not Happy, <hi>Dr. Moore</hi> is no more ſo than he. If any other hath diſcovered theſe Truths, he will oblige me that ſhall let me know it. I ſhall be rejoyc't to underſtand, that any other hath made the ſame diſcoveries: this will confirm me in the perſwaſion which I have, <hi>that I have found that which I inquired after.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After having proved in this <hi>ſecond part,</hi> that the <hi>end</hi> of the <hi>Reign of Antichriſt</hi> is at hand, I treat of that which is to follow <hi>after that Fall, viz.</hi> the famous <hi>Reign of Chriſt upon Earth,</hi> which hath been ſo often contradicted ſince the Beginning of the <hi>Chriſtian Church:</hi> I have inlarged a little upon it, as being one of the moſt conſolatory Truths which is in the whole Scripture, I cannot but aſcribe to a ſecret providence of God, that <hi>Blindneſs,</hi> which moſt <hi>Chriſtians</hi> have been under hitherto concerning it, for certain reaſons, God would not that they ſhould ſee that <hi>Reign of Chriſt</hi> in the <hi>Prophecies,</hi> tho it be there as clearly deſcribed as the <hi>Coming of the Meſſiah,</hi> which yet the <hi>Iews</hi> will not ſee to be there, you will therin find one <hi>Chapter,</hi> for which the <hi>Iews</hi> are indebted to me; for I re-eſtabliſh them in their <hi>Rights,</hi> and in their <hi>Hopes,</hi> farther than <hi>Chriſtians</hi> have as yet done. Among the proofs of the <hi>Reign</hi> of a <hi>thouſand years,</hi> you will find an explication of the <hi>Type</hi> of the work of <hi>Creation,</hi> which will not be unpleaſant to thoſe who love Myſteries. I have nothing to ſay in vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of <hi>this book.</hi> It muſt run the common riſque, it muſt be left to the Judgment of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick;
<pb facs="tcp:95320:19"/>a Riſque ſo much the greater, in that treating of <hi>Prophecies,</hi> no man thinks himſelf obliged to ſubſcribe to the thoughts of thoſe who interpret them. I may well expect to be ill treated by others, the learned and the wiſe, as they pretend to be, who mock at all <hi>Prophecies,</hi> and all thoſe who go about to interpret them; theſe men are upon the borders of Impiety, if they are not already plunged into it. 'Tis not for their ſakes that I write; I deſpiſe them, at leaſt their Judgment; but I pray God for their ſalvation: 'tis for the comfort of the Good and upright that this <hi>work</hi> was undertaken; God grant it may contribute to it; if I am deceived I ſhall have but my common Lot with many others; nevertheleſs, I deſerve ſome thanks for my good Intentions. Let me add one word, that this is not <hi>a book</hi> to be <hi>read</hi> Curſorily over, and that but once, I conſent that it be read the <hi>firſt</hi> Time as a <hi>Romance,</hi> but let ſuch a one <hi>return</hi> to it, and lay aſide his Prejudices by little and little, and at length accuſtom himſelf to thoſe <hi>Idea's</hi> that at firſt ſeemed ſtrange. This advice I give chiefly to <hi>Roman Catholicks,</hi> aſſoon as they perceive by the <hi>title</hi> of a <hi>Book,</hi> that the deſign is to perſwade them <hi>that their Religion is Antichriſtianiſm,</hi> they fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a rage, and their Paſſion blinds them. But yet for once let them take the pains to read it as a <hi>Romance,</hi> and afterwards let them think that the matter deſerves at leaſt to be examin'd, becauſe no leſs than their Eternal Salvation is concerned in it: I have no deſign to anger them; I deſire their Salvation. 'Tis the only end I propoſe, God is my witneſs.</p>

               <head>A Supplement to the Advice to all Chriſtians.</head>
               <p>This is what I have advertiſed the publick in the <hi>firſt Ediction;</hi> in this <hi>ſecond</hi> I find my ſelf obliged to <hi>remove two ſcandals,</hi> which I have learnt have been taken on the account of this <hi>book. Firſt,</hi> there are ſome who believe the hopes I give of a <hi>Re-eſtablishment,</hi> within a few <hi>years,</hi> may do much Hurt, becauſe all thoſe who are thus perſwaded, will ſuffer themſelves to ſleep ſecure in the mean time in the <hi>Communion</hi> of the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> ſaying, <hi>if it be thus, we may expect a while, and bear our Captivity as well as we can, we shall ere long ſee the end of it.</hi> During which expectation they will ſtill go to maſs, and joyn in the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitions of the <hi>Church of Rome.</hi> To this I have <hi>two</hi> things to ſay; <hi>Firſt,</hi> that God's ends and ways are different from ours; at this rate God ſhould never have promiſed to deliver his <hi>Church,</hi> that men might not grow ſecure in the Expectation of it. God hath almoſt always hid Events from us, and would not that <hi>at all times</hi> the <hi>Prophecies</hi> ſhould be underſtood, leſt the knowledg and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of them ſhould prejudice their <hi>accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment;</hi> leſt men ſhould oppoſe it, and ſtand upon their guard in that reſpect. But who knows whether God ought not at laſt to make the <hi>Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi> be underſtood, that they may the more eaſily be fulfilled? who knows, whether ſo many of the <hi>Romiſh Communion,</hi> who are already diſguſted with their <hi>Religion,</hi> may not open their Eyes by the Light which we ſet before them, and reſolve to become inſtruments in the hand of God, for the accompliſhment of this great work? 'tis certain that oftentimes <hi>Prophecies,</hi> Counterfeit, or Real,
<pb facs="tcp:95320:20"/>have inſpired thoſe for whom they were made, with the deſign to effect the things that were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed them: after all, when God diſcovers any truths of this nature, he hath his reaſons for doing ſo, and we ought not to reſiſt it, upon pretence of ſome ill Conſequences that would follow. <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remy,</hi> during the ſiege of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> declared to all the world, that the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> would take the <hi>City;</hi> ſhould he have forborn to ſpeak that Truth, which God had revealed to him, becauſe of ſome ill Conſequences? 'Tis evident, that nothing was more proper to leſſen the courage of the Inhabitants, and to promote the taking of the <hi>City</hi> of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> than ſuch a diſcourſe of the Prophet.</p>
               <p>The <hi>other thing</hi> which I have to ſay on this <hi>firſt ſcandal,</hi> is this, that ſuch who take occaſion from this <hi>Book</hi> to <hi>continue</hi> in the <hi>Roman ſuperſtition,</hi> waiting for deliverance, have no need of this book to cheriſh the diſpoſition they are in to remain there. They are people who only ſearch for Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, to flatter themſelves in the condition they are in, and can never want them either here or there, from this thing or another. But in truth, nothing can be more ridiculous than to take occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from hence, to continue in the <hi>Roman Church.</hi> In <hi>three</hi> or <hi>four</hi> years or more there will be a great change in the <hi>Papacy,</hi> we muſt than remain there, waiting till that <hi>Change</hi> happen; 'tis to the ſame effect as if I ſhould ſay, <hi>I am in an houſe that is on Fire, and that is ready to Fall, I have good aſſurance that in three or four years it will be rebuilt, therfore expecting that, I muſt ſuffer my ſelf to be burned in it, or to perish under its ruines. I am near a filthy and poiſoned water, in a little time ſome one will come and cleanſe the fountain, and render it whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome; in the mean time expecting that, let us drink
<pb facs="tcp:95320:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>of it.</hi> A man muſt be beſides himſelf, that ſhould argue after this rate; no leſs muſt he be, that ſhall reaſon as theſe cowards and Apoſtates do. <hi>Within ſome years the Reformation shall revive, waiting for that, I will continue in a wicked Religion, wherin I cannot be ſaved; I will pertake it its Idolatry, and baſely ſuppreſs the truth of God within my breaſt.</hi> A <hi>ſin</hi> of a quarter of an hour is enough to deſtroy a man Eternally; and ſhall it be thought, that the <hi>Idolatry</hi> and moſt ſhamefull <hi>Hypocriſy</hi> of two or three <hi>years</hi> are venial crimes? To betray a mans Conſcience and the Truth, by one ſingle act, deſerves Hell; and they flatter themſelves, that God will <hi>Indulge</hi> them in a <hi>treaſon</hi> continued in for ſeveral <hi>years:</hi> they who reaſon after this manner have they any revelation from God, that they ſhall live three or four years longer, or that they ſhall have the leaſure to repent? and what will become of them if they dye in that treaſonable ſtate? ſo far is the <hi>Hope</hi> that I give from being capable to make them <hi>continue</hi> where they are, that nothing can be more effectual to make them quit it. Their <hi>Poſſeſſions</hi> and <hi>profit</hi> is that which retains them; could they be perſwaded that in a few years they ſhould recover them again, it would not be ſo difficult to forſake them now.</p>
               <p>The other <hi>ſcandal</hi> which I know hath been taken, is concerning <hi>the Reign of a thouſand years;</hi> many <hi>Divines</hi> in this country have greatly murmured at it, even ſo far as to threaten to complain of me. I am ſorry it is ſo; for I ſhould be glad not to diſpleaſe my Brethren. In the mean time, I patiently expect what they will do in it; and by waiting, I ſhall know whether our <hi>Conducters</hi> intend to make <hi>new</hi> Articles of faith, and whether <hi>Coc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaniſme</hi> be become an intolerable Hereſy. <hi>M.
<pb facs="tcp:95320:21" rendition="simple:additions"/>Cocceius, upon the</hi> 11<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. <hi>Chap of the Apocalypſe,</hi> proves this <hi>Reign of Chriſt</hi> upon earth, by the ſame paſſages and the ſame arguments as I do, Except that he refers not to this the thouſand years of the <hi>Dragon</hi> being bound, in the 20<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. <hi>Chap.</hi> Since my arrival in theſe <hi>Provinces,</hi> I have fallen in with nothing of that famous <hi>Divine</hi> but in <hi>this article.</hi> If I ſhould have agreed with him in ſome others, I ſhould not be a ſhamed of it, and I know not what trouble any one can give me for one only article of agreement with many Able <hi>Divines,</hi> who are Good men, and very orthodox. But I would fain know what it is in this opinion that ſo much offends theſe Gentlemen. Is it any thing contrary to any Doctrine of faith, and which doth directly or indirectly ſtrike at the foundation? It is worth while to know, that ſuch as can produce a little of their own, and labour uſefully for the glory of God, if they hate the Spirit of Licentiouſneſs, are not like to become ſlaves to certain prevailing opinions, only on this account, becauſe they are prevailing. I ſhall conclude by advertiſing the Reader, that he will find this <hi>ſecond Edition</hi> to be inlarged throughout the whole <hi>book,</hi> eſpecially as to what is <hi>Prophetical</hi> in the <hi>Apocalypſe,</hi> which was not explained in the <hi>firſt Edition.</hi> It was believed, that by ſhowing a compleat ſyſtem of all the Events foretold in that book, we ſhould give the more light to each of the ſeveral <hi>Viſions;</hi> for we ſhall find that every thing is well followed, and that the order of the <hi>Prophecies</hi> is the ſame with that of the Events, or for the moſt part is ſo.</p>

                        <p>
                           <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen I undertook this Work, I had no Deſign to make a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat Commentary on that which is Prophetical in the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations,</hi> as did appear in the firſt Edition: However, when I obſerved
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:95320:26"/>that without deſigning it, I had explained almoſt the whole <hi>Apocalypſe,</hi> I did believe that as for three or four chapters that remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to be explained, I ought not to leave them behind, tho they had no reſpect to the ſcope of this book, which is to find out <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> &amp; learn when his Empire muſt end. When one ſees a ſyſtem that is very perfect, &amp; well attended with all the events foretold in this book, this will give ſuch a fair aſpect of truth to all the parts of it, as will be moſt eaſily perceived. Moreover the publick may have obſerved, that in the pourtraiture of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, I have referred the Reader in many chapters, as in the 13<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. &amp; the 17<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. to my Book of <hi>Prejudices.</hi> Now us I have promiſed to epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomize the book of <hi>Prejudices,</hi> I thought it would be more proper to bring out of that book into this preſent work all that reſpects the Prophecies &amp; their Explication on the ſubject of the deſcription of Antichriſtianiſm, than to refer a part of this to another Book. So that in this ſecond Edition there will be found an explication of all that is propheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal in the book of the <hi>Revelation.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>We believe with the learned <hi>Joſeph Mede</hi> that this book is divided into two parts. The <hi>firſt</hi> is contained in the book ſealed with ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſeals, which is to be ſeen in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. Ch. And the ſecond in the book which the Angel gave to <hi>S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. John</hi> in the 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. Ch. The two little books move upon the ſame time; the one &amp; the other reach even to the end of the World; but they do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:95320:26"/>ſay the ſame thing, &amp; have not the ſame object. For the firſt little book that appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth ſealed with ſeven ſeals, principally reſpects the affairs &amp; the adventures of the firſt Period of the fourth Monarchy, viz. the <hi>temporal Roman Empire.</hi> And the ſecond book contains the deſtinies of the Church corrupted during the ſame ages, &amp; the ſame duration of time; this is what we call the <hi>Spiritual Roman Empire.</hi> I ſay, that the firſt book contains properly the deſtinies of the Empire; not but that thoſe of the Church are included in it too. For that which God foretold ſhould befall the <hi>Roman Empire,</hi> was always with reſpect to the Church, to its Perſecutions, &amp; the great Changes that befall it. So that to ſpeak properly, the whole work reſpects the Church. But the ſecond little book, which reaches from the 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the end, reſpects the Church, &amp; what was to befall it, much more particularly, yea &amp; more clearly.</p>
                        <p>The firſt thing that appears in the book of the <hi>Revelation</hi> is the ſeven Epiſtles to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven principal Churches of <hi>Aſia,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Q. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the ſeven Epiſtles are Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical?</note> contained in the three firſt Chapters. Tis very much queſtion'd whether theſe Epiſtles are Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical or not. Some maintain that they are with a great deal of heat, &amp; others deny it. As for me, I have nothing certain to ſay upon it. So that I would not raiſe a preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice againſt any perſon or any opinion by my own; tho I am much more enclined to believe that there is nothing of prophecy in
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:95320:27"/>them, but that all that is ſaid in theſe Epiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, refers to things that had happened in thoſe ſeven Churches. It is certain that the <hi>Revelation</hi> is nothing but an Epiſtle. This is clear by its beginning &amp; end. Now it was not uſuall with the Apoſtles to direct their Epiſtles to the Univerſal Church in generall of all places &amp; all times, as ſome would have <hi>S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. John</hi> here to have done. The Apoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les were wont in their Epiſtles to rank in the firſt place what they had which was dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical &amp; Prophetical to write of; &amp; after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward came that which reſpected what was moral. This is the method of <hi>St. Paul. St. John</hi> on the contrary in this Epiſtle ſets that which is moral therein, before that which is Prophetical. The reaſon is becauſe he little deſign'd to ſtay upon that which is moral, &amp; his principal aim was to relate the viſions which God had given him. Therefore he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patcheth in the beginning that which was to make the leaſt part of his Epiſtle, &amp; which was leſs important, that without diverſion he might ſtick to that which he principally intended therein.</p>
                        <p>I ſee but one thing that ſeems mightily to favour the opinion of thoſe that believe that the ſeven Epiſtles are Prophetical.<note place="margin">Why the H. Spirit wrote but to ſeven Churches.</note> 'Tis the number of ſeven. Why did the H. Spirit write to no more than ſeven Churches? Were there not many more in <hi>Aſia?</hi> Were theſe the only ones in which there was any thing to be reproved, or to whom the H. Spirit had ſomething to ſay?</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="5" facs="tcp:95320:27"/>
It ſeems therefore that the ſeven Churches are the Univerſal Church of all Ages divided into ſeven Periods. But this reaſon doth not appear ſtrong enough to me. <hi>Firſt,</hi> becauſe the number of ſeven is evidently conſecrated in the <hi>Revelation.</hi> The holy Spirit uſeth it in counting up all things, the ſeven Spirits, ſeven Lamps, ſeven Angels, &amp;c. Surely whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver we underſtand hereby, 'tis certain that the number of Spirits, of Lamps &amp; of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gells is not reduced to the number of ſeven. Not but that oftentimes the number of ſeven in the <hi>Revelation</hi> muſt be taken for a deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate number as in the ſeven Seals, in the ſeven Trumpets, &amp; the ſeven Vialls; but that is when the diviſion of time into Periods is treated of. Now this is that which is doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, that by theſe ſeven Churches are meant ſeven Periods. And we ſhall alſo ſee here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after that what is ſaid to theſe ſeven Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches doth not at all agree with the events, in what manner ſoever the times be divided. So that this only thing that the H. Spirit ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth here ſeven Churches doth not prove that they are ſo many Period's of the duration of the Church. 'Tis probable that by theſe he means all the other Churches of <hi>Aſia,</hi> and if any will have it ſo, all thoſe that were at that time in the world. And he choſe among theſe ſeven the names of the principal ones, intending that the other leſſer Churches ſhould reckon that as ſpoken concerning their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent eſtate, which is ſpoken to the ſeven prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal ones among them.</p>
                        <p n="2">
                           <pb n="6" facs="tcp:95320:28"/>
                           <hi>2dly,</hi> Who knows whether there were at that time more than ſeven conſiderable Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in <hi>Aſia?</hi> The other were ſo very much below theſe, for Dignity, Grandure &amp; Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency, that the H. Spirit judged it not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to make any account of them, the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſements that he gives to theſe ſeven Churches being ſufficient for the Diſorders which might be in all the others, which Diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders were apparently the ſame. For 'tis uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all enough for little flocks to follow the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of the greater ones.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Laſtly,</hi> it doth not appear that the holy Spirit, in what follows, hath divided the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Church ſince J. Chriſt's time to the end of the world, or to the coming of Jeſus Chriſt's Kingdom into ſeven Periods. For the ſeven ſeals, the ſeven Trumpets, the ſeven Vialls, do not each of them take up all time. They ſucceed one another: The ſeventh ſeal brings forth ſeven Trumpets, &amp; the ſixth Trumpet is ſubdivided into ſeven Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alls. It had been very methodical in a Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, after having obſcurely mark'd out the ſeven Periods of the Church by the ſeven Epiſtles, to deſcribe the ſame times by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven other Characters more obſervable &amp; more diſtinct. This is indeed what ſome modern writers do believe that God hath done; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending that the ſeven ſeals &amp; the ſeven Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets are co-temporary, &amp; divide the duration of the Chriſtian Church into ſeven Periods, as the ſeven Epiſtles to the ſeven Churches do. But this opinion will not appear probable to thoſe
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:95320:28"/>that ſtudy the Prophecies &amp; the events with any application of mind.</p>
                        <p>I look on that as nothing that is ſaid to ſupport the myſtery of the ſeven Churches, <hi>viz.</hi> that we do not ſee that ſuch things hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened in the ſeven Churches of <hi>Aſia,</hi> which are there named, as have any reſemblance with what the H. Spirit ſaith to them. How ſhould we ſee it, ſeeing we have not the particular Hiſtory of thoſe Churches in that time? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, tho we do not know the particulars of thoſe events, yet there is nothing in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Epiſtles which doth not very well agree with the Eſtate of the Church that then was; without any neceſſity to ſeek out events my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtically meant in future ages.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">The ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications that are made of the ſeven Epiſtles to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ods are not hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py.</note>The principal thing that hinders me from cloſing with the opinion of the Prophetical ſenſe of the Epiſtles, is that I do not find that the applications which are made of them to the Ages that have paſt ſince the Apoſtles, do anſwer expectation. 'Tis true, there are ſome places where the applications are not unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py. But ſeeing this is not to be met with every where, I believe that they have hit luckily by chance. Otherwiſe the Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy ſhould every where agree with the events. To the end one may better judge of the force of this laſt reaſon, I ſhall ſet down two or three of the myſtical interpretations that are given to theſe Epiſtles. This will pleaſe thoſe who cannot or will not go to ſeek them in their Springs.</p>
                        <p>I begin with that of <hi>Patrick Forbes</hi> a Scotch
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:95320:29"/>Divine,<note place="margin">The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of the ſeven Churches by <hi>Forbes.</hi>
                           </note> that lived &amp; died in the beginning of this age. According to him the Church of <hi>Epheſus</hi> ſignifies the Primitive Church of the three firſt Ages. The Praiſes which the H. Spirit gives it, <hi>I know thy works &amp; thy labour, &amp; how thou canſt not bear them which are evil, &amp;c.</hi> Theſe praiſes I ſay may well agree to the Church of the three firſt Ages. But thoſe which God gives to the Church of <hi>Thya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tira</hi> afterwards are greater. Yet 'tis certain that the fourth Period of the Church did not come near the Church of the three firſt Ages in fervency &amp; purity. The <hi>Nicolaitans</hi> that are ſpoken of in this Epiſtle to the Church of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> may ſignifie all the Hereticks, all the kinds being meant by one. But ſeeing the Church of all Ages hath had its Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, this character can't diſtinguiſh this Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod from the others.</p>
                        <p>The ſecond Epiſtle is to the Church of <hi>Smyrna,</hi> &amp; <hi>Forbes</hi> would have this to be the Period in which the <hi>Arrians, Macedonians, Neſtorians</hi> &amp; <hi>Eutychians</hi> reigned. That is to ſay, that this Period will comprehend the fourth, &amp; the fifth Age. But how can theſe words be applied to thoſe Ages, <hi>I know thy works &amp; thy Tribulation, &amp; thy poverty (but thou art rich) &amp; I know the blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy of thoſe that ſay they are Jews but are not, but are the Synagogue of Satan?</hi> See here are praiſes that are no whit inferiour to thoſe that were given to the Church of <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus.</hi> Yet 'tis certain that the Church, in theſe Ages was corrupted, &amp; loſt all the beauty
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:95320:29"/>it had in the three firſt Ages of the Church. Its manners were corrupted, &amp; its worſhip was marred by the invocation of Saints &amp; the worſhip of Reliques. What will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of that <hi>Perſecution of ten days</hi> that God predicts to this Church of <hi>Smyrna?</hi> 'Tis true the Church was perſecuted under the <hi>Arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Emperours;</hi> but it doth not appear very well why this is deſcribed by number of ten days.</p>
                        <p>The third Epiſtle is directed to the Church of <hi>Pergamus,</hi> &amp; according to <hi>Forbes</hi> this is the Period of the reign of Antichriſt. The foregoing Periods were but of two or three hundred years; this muſt be above a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years. Here is found ſomething that is pretty like this Period. <hi>I know where thou dwelleſt, even where Satan's ſeat is.</hi> To which may be added that the martyr <hi>Antipas</hi> ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of in this Epiſtle ſignifies <hi>Anti-papa,</hi> an Enemy oppoſing the Pope; &amp; that this ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies all thoſe that have oppoſed the tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of Antichriſt. But the reſt doth by no means agree to this Period. <hi>I know thy works, &amp; that thou holdeſt faſt my name, &amp; haſt not denied my faith.</hi> Theſe praiſes do by no neans belong to a Church ſo corrupt as was that of the third Period under the reign of Antichriſt. <hi>Thou haſt them that hold the Doctrine of</hi> Balaam <hi>who taught</hi> Balak <hi>to caſt a ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling-block before the Children of Iſrael, to eat things ſacrificed unto Idols &amp; to commit fornication.</hi> By this muſt be meant thoſe evil Chriſtians that joined in with the Antichriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:95320:30"/>Idolatry. Now theſe people are not well deſcribed by <hi>thou haſt them;</hi> for this imports, that it was not the body of the Society. And on the contrary, under the Antichriſtian Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, the greateſt part of men did partake of his abominations.</p>
                        <p>The fourth Epiſtle is directed to the Church of <hi>Thyatira,</hi> to which the H. Spirit gives theſe great praiſes <hi>I know thy works, &amp; Charity, &amp; ſervice, &amp; Patience; &amp; that thy laſt works are more than the firſt.</hi> Forbes would have this be that Period of the Church, in which the Church began to reform her ſelf, &amp; in which the good ſeparated from the evil. <hi>i. e.</hi> the Church from the <hi>Albigenſes</hi> to <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi> time. Now I leave every wiſe man to judge if a ſmall number of <hi>Albigenſes</hi> &amp; <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſes,</hi> that ſeparated from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> &amp; that endured ſo ſhort a time, could deſerve from the whole Chriſtian Church, ſo generally corrupted, the faireſt of all the prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes that the H. Spirit gives to the ſeven Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Thou ſuffereſt that woman</hi> Jezabel <hi>that cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth her ſelf a Propheteſs, to teach &amp; to ſeduce my ſervants to commit fornication.</hi> This <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabel</hi> I confeſs very much reſembles the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſtian Church. But Why ſhould the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bigenſes</hi> be blamed for ſuffering the <hi>Roman</hi> Church? How could they deſtroy it, who were ſo weak? Did they not cry out upon her as <hi>Babylon</hi> as much as they were able?</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Sardis,</hi> is the fifth Church to which the H. Spirit writes, &amp; according to <hi>Forbes</hi> 'tis
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:95320:30"/>the Reformed Church, in which neither <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabel,</hi> nor <hi>Balaam,</hi> nor the <hi>Pope</hi> nor <hi>Popery</hi> are any longer tolerated, becauſe ſhe broke with the <hi>Roman</hi> Church. But why would we have the Ages of our <hi>Reformation</hi> ſince <hi>Luther</hi> to be branded with ſo black &amp; fatal a Character, <hi>Thou haſt a name to live, but art dead? Be watchful, &amp; ſtrengthen the things which remain, &amp; are ready to dy; for I have not found thy works perfect before God.</hi> I think our <hi>Reformation</hi> deſerved at leaſt as much praiſe as that of the <hi>Albigenſes.</hi> The Zeal thereof was great, &amp; the Doctrine pure.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Philadelphia</hi> is the ſixth Church, &amp; ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies according to <hi>Forbes,</hi> the Church that ſhall carry the Reformation to its greateſt height, that ſhall have but a ſmall number of members, but they ſhall be very Zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Laodicea</hi> is the laſt Church or the laſt Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod. The Holy Spirit terribly blames it. <hi>Thou art neither hot nor cold. Thou ſaiſt I am rich, &amp; have need of nothing, &amp;c. &amp; doſt not know that thou art wretched, &amp; miſerable, &amp; poor, &amp; blind, &amp; naked.</hi> According to <hi>Forbes</hi> this is thoſe Churches that making all their glory to conſiſt in their having quitted <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi> do fall back, &amp; make Religion to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in nothing but duties purely external. This laſt Period muſt be placed at the end of the World. Thus you have <hi>Forbes's</hi> ſyſtem.</p>
                        <p>Let us proceed to that of <hi>Cocceius.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>According to this later Author, the Church of <hi>Epheſus</hi> is the Apoſtolical Church, <hi>i. e.</hi>

                           </note> So that this Period muſt be extended to the death of <hi>S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. John.</hi> The <hi>Nicolaitans</hi> ſpoken of in this firſt Epiſtle, are Hereticks in general. <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colaos</hi> in Greek ſignifies the <hi>Conquerour of the People.</hi> 'Tis the Character of Hereticks to make themſelves maſters of the people by ſeducing them.</p>
                        <p>The Church of <hi>Smyrna</hi> ſignifies the Church ſuffering in all places, &amp; eſpecially that of the three firſt Ages. The perſecution of <hi>ten Days</hi> according to this, muſt ſignify the ten Perſecutions, which the Church ſuffered du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring thoſe three Ages under the <hi>Pagan</hi> Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours. This doth not fall out ill; but I fear it was chance that made this hit; for the reſt doth not fall out in the ſame manner. The holy Spirit ſaith, <hi>Some of you ſhall be caſt into Priſon, that ye may be tryed.</hi> This is very feebly to expreſs the great number of Martyrs, and the cruel Sufferings to which the Church was expoſed during theſe three firſt Ages of the Church. 'Tis much more probable, that this ſignifies ſome light Perſecution that was to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fal <hi>Smyrna,</hi> in which Perſecution the Evil ſhould not go beyond the impriſoning ſome perticular Perſons.</p>
                        <p>The Epiſtle to the Church of <hi>Pergamus</hi> is the third, &amp; according to <hi>Cocceius,</hi> 'tis the Church from <hi>Conſtantine's</hi> time to the birth of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt. <hi>Pergamus</hi> is the name of a famous for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs of <hi>Troy. Rome</hi> ſignifies ſtrength or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs. 'Tis in <hi>Rome</hi> that ſatan's ſeat is. But why ſhould the ſeat of ſatan be fixed in <hi>Rome</hi>
                           <pb n="13" facs="tcp:95320:31"/>converted by <hi>Conſtantine?</hi> It had been much better to have fix'd it in <hi>Rome Pagan,</hi> or to reſerve it for <hi>Rome Antichriſtian</hi> that was to follow immediately after. <hi>Antipas</hi> the martyr ſignifies (ſaith he) the Orthodox that main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd the conſubſtantiality of the Son. <hi>Antipas</hi> for <hi>Antipatros,</hi> &amp; <hi>Antipatros</hi> for <hi>Iſopatros,</hi> equal to the Father. I have nothing to ſay hereupon, but it doth not pleaſe me every well.</p>
                        <p>The Church of <hi>Thyatira</hi> is the fourth, &amp; ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies according to <hi>Cocceius</hi> the Church under the reign of Antichriſt. <hi>Jezabel</hi> that appears in this Epiſtle is the Antichriſtian Church. They that ſuffer <hi>Jezabel</hi> the Propheteſs are the elect mingled among the Antichriſtian Idolaters. That ſickneſs that God would ſend on <hi>Jezabel</hi> in caſting her on her bed, are thoſe mortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which Antichriſtianiſm was to receive by the ſeveral diſaſters that befel the <hi>Roman</hi> Church till the Reformation. This falls out pretty well, but 'tis by meer chance; for how can that magnificent Elogy be applied to this period of the Antichriſtian church, <hi>I know thy works, &amp; thy charity, &amp; thy patience, &amp; that thy laſt works are more than the firſt?</hi> Never was the church ſo void of ſaints &amp; of good works as in this ſad Period.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Sardis</hi> is the fifth Church &amp; the fifth Period, &amp; according to <hi>Cocceius</hi> as well as according to <hi>Forbes</hi> 'tis the Reformed Church. But I ſay hereto as I ſaid before on occaſion of <hi>Forbes,</hi> why ſhould we ſay of our Reformation <hi>thou haſt a name to live, &amp; behold thou art dead; ſtrengthen the things which remain &amp; are ready to dy.</hi>

<pb n="16" facs="tcp:95320:33"/>contrary to the Pope. This is a little glitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Light, but I am much afraid 'tis a Deceitful one. For <hi>Firſt,</hi> Why ſhould we compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, in this Empire of Satan, the Reigns of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> and <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> which were ſo happy for the Church? <hi>2dly,</hi> Why ſhould it be ſaid to this Antichriſtian Period, <hi>I know thy Good Works, and that thou haſt not Denyed my Name?</hi> ſeeing there never were fewer that made profeſſion of the Truth, than in this Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod. If ever the Church may be accuſed of having renounced the Name of Jeſus Chriſt, 'tis in the time of Antichriſtianiſm, which is called an Apoſtacy: ſo that this Article doth not hit well; but that which follows doth much worſe.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Thyatira,</hi> according to this Author, is the Church from the time that the <hi>Albigenſes</hi> were deſtroyed, to that time that entire Nations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon'd the Communion of <hi>Rome.</hi> 'Tis it may be a time the moſt barren in Virtue, and the moſt overwhelm'd with Superſtition, that ever was ſince Jeſus Chriſt: yet muſt this great Praiſe be attributed to it, <hi>I know thy Works, and thy Patience, and thy Charity; and that thy laſt Works are more than the firſt.</hi> What is ſaid to the Church of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> which 'tis pretended is the Apoſtolical Church, is not ſo honourable, nor ſo great; <hi>Thou ſuffereſt the Woman</hi> Iezabel, <hi>that calls her ſelf a Propheteſs.</hi> How can this be applied to thoſe Ages that have run out ſince the Ruin of the <hi>Albigenſes,</hi> to the Reformation? <hi>Jezabel,</hi> that <hi>Roman</hi> Whore, hath not only been ſuffer'd and tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated,

                           <hi>Sardis</hi> is the fifth Church, which ſignifies the fifth Period according to Dr. <hi>More;</hi> and this Period is that of the Reformation, to the laſt Vial, <hi>i.e.</hi> to the laſt Ruin of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt. 'Tis to this Church that the Holy Spirit ſaith, <hi>Thou haſt a Name to live, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold thou art dead.</hi> Can it be imagin'd, that God ſhould give ſuch great Praiſes to the Church that was ſince the Ruin of the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bigenſes</hi> till the Reformation, and that the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit ſhould be made to ſpeak with ſo much Diſdain of the Reformed Church? What compariſon is there between the Church in its Reformation, &amp; that corrupted Church, wherein hardly any was to be found that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd himſelf from the mighty Corruption of Error and Vice?</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> which is the ſixth Church, ſignifies a ſixth Period, wherein Antichriſt ſhall be entirely ruin'd, and the Infidel Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons be converted. This is to divine; and that which the Holy Spirit ſaith to the ſixth Church, doth not exactly import any ſuch thing.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Laſtly; Laodicea,</hi> of which the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit ſpeaks in ſuch diſadvantageous terms, is the Church that muſt fall into decay after the Fall of Antichriſt, and the Converſion of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. And this Decay muſt bring the Church to the coming of the Kingdom of Jeſus Chriſt on the Earth. See here a new Period, and of which there is not the leaſt foot-ſtep in all the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:95320:34"/>Prophecies. 'Tis a Period that muſt run out from the Ruin of Antichriſt, and the Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the People. All the Prophecies fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell, that the Reign of Jeſus Chriſt ſhall come immediately after the Fall of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and <hi>the Fulneſs of the Gentiles.</hi> Yet here behold a Period, that ſeparates theſe two Events, which ought to be joyned together.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Laſtly;</hi> this Syſtem is ſubject to the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies as that of <hi>Cocceius.</hi> There muſt be ſuppoſed an eighth Period for the reign of the thouſand years, which Dr. <hi>More</hi> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges. Now it muſt be confeſſed, that this eighth Period is altogether unknown to the Prophets; for we do not any where find, that the time hath been divided into Eight parts.</p>
                        <p>Thoſe that will attentively reflect on what we have juſt now ſaid, will confeſs, if I am not much miſtaken, either that theſe Epiſtles to the ſeven Churches are not prophetical, or that the Myſtery hath not yet been diſcovered: For nothing that hath been ſaid about them, hath this certain Character of Truth, which is obvious to every one. The Prophecies muſt be like <hi>Aenigma's,</hi> which till they have been well explained, ſeem unintelligible; but when one hath hit right upon them, they appear ſo clear, that they cannot otherwiſe be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood.</p>

                           <p>An Explication of the Viſion of the four living Creatures, &amp; of the twenty four Elders, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the fourth Chapter.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>SEeing there's nothing propheticall in the three firſt chapters of the <hi>Revelation</hi> we may go on to the fourth Chapter. One may ſay, that this is the opening of this great &amp; divine Theater on which theſe admirable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical Viſions will immediatly appear. The entrance is like that of the Prophet <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiel.</hi> God appears in the Temple, which is in heaven, ſitting on a magnificent Throne. Round about the throne there is a <hi>Rainbow:</hi> this is the Symbol of Peace. Before the Throne there was <hi>a Sea of Glaſs like to Chryſtal.</hi> This may ſignify the Purity of the Doctrine of the Goſpel, by which we are waſhed &amp; juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. It is of Glaſs &amp; of Chryſtal, becauſe of its firmneſs. For the Goſpel is an eternal Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, that ſhall not be done away by a new covenant.</p>
                        <p>But that which is moſt conſiderable, here is the four living Creatures &amp; the twenty four Elders that are round about the Throne.</p>

                           <note place="margin">The opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of <hi>J. Mede</hi> about theſe four living Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atures &amp; the twenty four El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</note>We muſt firſt know what theſe four living Creatures are, &amp; then we ſhall eaſily gueſs what the twenty four elders ſignify. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture of jour, <hi>Joſeph Mede</hi> is ingenious &amp; learned. He believes theſe four living Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures repreſent the whole <hi>Chriſtian</hi>-Church, <hi>i. e.</hi> all the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> People, by way of alluſion to the encampings of ancient Iſrael: It was, ſaith he, diſtributed into four bodies, three tribes in each body, each body had its com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding tribe that marched in the front; &amp; every one of theſe four tribes had its ſtandard, wherin was the figure of a living Creature. <hi>Judah</hi> marched in the front of the <hi>Firſt</hi> body, &amp; had under it <hi>Iſſachar</hi> &amp; <hi>Zabulon. Reuben</hi> was the ſecond head, &amp; had under it <hi>Simeon</hi> &amp; <hi>Gad.</hi> The third head was <hi>Ephraim,</hi> which
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:95320:35"/>had under it <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> &amp; <hi>Benjamin.</hi> The fourth head was <hi>Dan,</hi> to which were joined the tribes of <hi>Aſſer</hi> &amp; <hi>Naphtali.</hi> This is what we read in the ſecond Ch. of <hi>Numbers.</hi> Tis certain alſo that every one of theſe four bodies had its Banner &amp; its Enſign. For in the ſame place there is expreſs mention of four ſtandards. v. 3. <hi>The ſtandard of the company of Judah.</hi> v. 10. <hi>The Banner of the company of Reuben.</hi> v. 18. <hi>The Banner of the company of Ephraim.</hi> &amp; v. 25. <hi>The Banner of the company of Dan.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But to this 'tis added, that theſe four Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners had the figure of four living Creatures. That of <hi>Judah</hi> had the figure of a <hi>Lion;</hi> that of <hi>Ephraim</hi> of an <hi>Ox;</hi> that of <hi>Reuben</hi> of a <hi>Man;</hi> &amp; that of <hi>Dan</hi> of an <hi>Eagle.</hi> As for this laſt point tis known only by tradition. <hi>Aben Ezra</hi> ſaith ſo, <hi>Barnachman and Chaſkuni</hi> all ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry modern Authors, &amp; of little authority. Wherefore this laſt circumſtance of theſe four living Creatures painted in the four banners is more than uncertain. It is not ſo much as probable. For God that knew the great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination which this people had to Idolatry, would not have tempted them in placing among them images in ſo eminent a place. Yet 'tis principally on this circumſtance that the conjecture is founded. For he would have theſe four living Creatures of the <hi>Revelation</hi> repreſent all the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> people, becauſe of the ancient <hi>Iſrael</hi> that marched under theſe four Banners. Suppoſing that theſe four li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Creatures ſignify all the faithfull people, it muſt alſo be ſuppoſed that the twenty four
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:95320:36"/>Elders repreſent the Paſtors, &amp; that they poſſeſs that place in the viſion which the <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites</hi> &amp; <hi>Prieſts</hi> held in the aſſembly of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> This alſo is the opinion of <hi>Joſeph Mede.</hi> And he believes that the number of twenty four refers to the twenty four Claſſes of Prieſts which <hi>K. David</hi> made.</p>
                        <p>To find out the truth we have nothing elſe to do but to invert the opinion of <hi>Joſeph Mede,</hi> &amp; ſay, that the twenty four Elders re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent the people, &amp; the four living Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures the Paſtors. That the twenty four Elders &amp; the four living Creatures both together repreſent the whole body of the Church com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of Paſtors &amp; people. This is unqueſtio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably ſo, &amp; whoever doth but carefully mind the matter, will not doubt it. But that the four living Creatures ſignify the Paſtors, will not be doubted neither, when the thing is well conſidered.</p>

Paul: They are cloathd in white Raiment:</hi> That is the habit of a Prieſt. And that ſignifies, that the Prieſthood is no longer confined to one only Tribe, that the eleven tribes are re-entred into their ancient rights. For naturally all the firſt-born of what tribe ſoever they were, were Prieſts. This is what the Holy Spirit means when he calls the faithful ones of the New Teſtament <hi>the firſt-born, Prieſts,</hi> &amp; <hi>a royal Prieſt-hood.

                           <p>The Key of the Revelation. This book is no other than a comment on what <hi>Daniel</hi> ſaith in the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. Ch. of his Revelations, touching the fourth Beaſt, &amp; the fourth Monarchy.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>BEhold the Theater open'd &amp; prepared; we proceed to view the Viſions that are as ſo many Entrings. But I think it neceſſary to premiſe in the firſt place an Obſervation which I call the <hi>Key</hi> of the <hi>Revelation.</hi> 'Tis, that this whole Book is nothing but a Paraphraſe on what <hi>Daniel</hi> ſaith in the ſeventh Ch. of his revelations touching the fourth Beaſt. Certainly this fourth Beaſt is the <hi>Roman Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,</hi> the fourth Monarchy. And if ſome great
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:95320:39"/>&amp; ſtrange events be found therin, 'tis always with reſpect to the <hi>Roman Empire,</hi> that muſt endure to the coming of the Kingdom of J. Chriſt on the Earth.<note place="margin">VVhy God hath nor taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of other States in the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</note> The reaſon why God taking no notice of ſo many great events that happen without the bounds of the <hi>Roman Empire,</hi> of the great Empires that are eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſht, the nations that are overturned, the bloody Wars that are every where, &amp; inſiſts only on the fourth Monarchy, or the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Empire, is becauſe god reveals not future events but with reſpect to the Church which he loveth, which he conducts, &amp; which he will inſtruct concerning his will. Now the Church was to be encloſed in or very near within the bounds of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire. I know that there were <hi>Chriſtian</hi>-Churches in <hi>Perſia,</hi> &amp; it may be ſome in the <hi>Indies.</hi> But all this was but a ſmall matter. <hi>Euphrates</hi> was the bounds of Chriſtianity; it ſpread it ſelf but a little beyond it. The Church therfore had no need to know that which ſhould happen on the other ſide <hi>Euphrates,</hi> nor to underſtand the foundation of the Empires of the <hi>Tartars,</hi> the Kings of <hi>Perſia,</hi> the <hi>Mogulls</hi> &amp; the <hi>Chinois;</hi> for all this had no reſpect to her. Wherfore the Revelation ſaith not one word of them. The Spirit of God alſo had no intention to inſtruct us in the adventures of the Empire of the <hi>Saracens</hi> &amp; that of the <hi>Turks,</hi> but with reference to the fourth Monarchy. Therfore we ſhall not ſee theſe two Empires that of the <hi>Saracens</hi> &amp; that of the <hi>Tarcks</hi> but
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:95320:40"/>only by the by in the fifth &amp; ſixth Trumpets; &amp; we ſhall not ſee them there but as the Scour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of God that fall on the fourth monarchy to vex &amp; to deſtroy it. This obſervation is the <hi>Key</hi> of the <hi>Revelation.</hi> For <hi>firſt,</hi> it removes that difficulty which many make ſo great a ſtir about, <hi>viz.</hi> that the <hi>Revelation</hi> as tis uſually explained, doth not at all touch on, or if it doth; 'tis but by the by, the greateſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volutions of the World, that happen'd in the Eaſt ſince 1200 years. Yet once more, it was not the work of him who would ſpeak of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the Church &amp; thoſe Events, that have in immediate reference to the Church. <hi>Secondly,</hi> This obſervation will teach us rightly to divide the times of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly to apply the viſions to each time, &amp; to diſcover the events that are ſignified by thoſe Viſions.</p>
                        <p>We muſt know therefore, that the fourth monarchy without compariſon the greateſt,<note place="margin">The divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the fourth Monarchy into two Periods.</note> &amp; moſt diſtinguiſhed in the Prophecies is divided into two great periods. The <hi>firſt</hi> is from the birth of Rome <hi>ab urbe conditâ,</hi> which was the great <hi>Epocha</hi> of the <hi>Romans,</hi> to the divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire into ten Kingdoms, which was after the death of <hi>Valentinian</hi> the third about the year 455. For then the Empire was torn in pieces between the <hi>Greeks,</hi> the <hi>Vandals,</hi> the <hi>Goths,</hi> the <hi>Burgundians</hi> &amp;c. it was I ſay divided into ten principal parts. The ſecond period of the fourth monarchy is ſince the diviſion of the Empire among ten Kings, &amp; the reunion of thoſe ten Kings under one
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:95320:40"/>ſole head, that calls himſelf the univerſal Bishop, to the end of this monarchy, &amp; the coming of the fifth, which is that of J. Chriſt on the Earth. Theſe two periods are very near of the ſame length, viz. 1200 years or a little more. The Lord J. Chriſt came into the world <hi>Anno <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>. C.</hi> 754. or 752. as <hi>Dionyſius</hi> the leſſer pretends. The Empire was divided into ten Kingdomes about the year of J. Chriſt 455. i. e. in the year 1209 or 1207 of the city of <hi>Rome;</hi> ſince that time under the <hi>Roman</hi> &amp; <hi>Gothiſh</hi> Kings the counting <hi>ab urbe conditâ</hi> was continued till the time of <hi>Dionyſius</hi> the leſſer a <hi>Roman</hi> Abbot, a <hi>Scythian</hi> by nation, who died in the year 540 according to <hi>Baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> &amp; who made his Paſchal cycle in the year 527. Tis about the year 530 that the Chriſtian <hi>Aera</hi> began to be in uſe, &amp; the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting by the years of J. Chriſt. Then men left off counting <hi>ab urbe conditâ</hi> after they had uſed this <hi>Epocha</hi> about 1280 years. However that be, the period from the building of <hi>Rome</hi> to the diviſion of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire among ten Kings is more than 1200 years. The ſecond period of the fourth monarchy ſince its diviſion among ten Kings to the end muſt be alſo above 1200 years. The Prophecy makes it 1260 pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical days, i.e. 1260 years.</p>
                        <p>Now we muſt obſerve that in the time of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Iohn.</hi> i. e. in the time when he wrote the <hi>Revelation,</hi> there was above two thirds of the firſt period of the fourth monarchy paſt &amp; gone. For the wrote about the year 850 after the building of the city. There remain'd ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:95320:41"/>but a little more than 350 years of this firſt period. But he had before him the whole entire ſecond period of 1260 years. Wherfore tis not very ſtrange that he enlargeth himſelf much more on this later part than on the former. So that we ſhall not find properly more than two chapters the ſixth &amp; the eighth that reſpect this firſt period of the fourth mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy; and all the reſt from the ninth ch. in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſively to the 20<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, excluſively contains the events that belong to the period of the 1260 Years, which is the ſecond of the fourth Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy. To render this truth more plain that the Prophecy of <hi>Daniel</hi> touching the fourth Monarchy is the Text on which the H. Spirit treats in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> we muſt here view the Prophecy of <hi>Daniel</hi> &amp; apply it to divers parts of that of <hi>St. John.</hi>

                           <hi>Daniel</hi> having asked the explication of this viſion, the Angel ſaith to him hereupon; <hi>The fourth beaſt ſhall be the fourth Kingdom on the Earth,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">v. 23.</note> 
                           <hi>which ſhall be diverſe from all King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, &amp; ſhall devour the whole Earth, &amp; tread it down &amp; break it in pieces.</hi> This refers to the eſtabliſhment of this <hi>Empire,</hi> &amp; its conqueſts, that were begun under the <hi>Conſuls</hi> &amp; <hi>Dictators,</hi> &amp; were finiſht under the <hi>Emperours;</hi> of which <hi>St. John.</hi> had ſeen a part, &amp; ſome followed
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:95320:41" rendition="simple:additions"/>after him; under whom alſo the Empire was always enlarged, or at leaſt preſerved in its greatneſs even to the children of <hi>Theodoſius. It broke in pieces the whole Earth, &amp; ſtamped the reſidue with the feet of it.</hi> For it mortifyed all its neighbours whom it did not Subdue. The 6<hi rend="sup">th</hi>.

                        </p>
                        <p>See the diviſion of the fourth Monarchy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ten others, which was made after the year 450. We ſhall ſee afterwards which are theſe ten Kingdoms. From the midſt of theſe ten comes up a little horn, a Monarch that appears as nothing, a <hi>Prieſt</hi> that inſenſibly encreaſes his power over theſe ten Kings, ſo
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:95320:42"/>far as to take away the third part of their Demains, Juriſdiction &amp; Power. This is what hath been exactly accompliſht in the <hi>Papacy,</hi> which hath taken away from the Weſtern Kings more than a third part of their Eſtate, which is become Church Lands, &amp; dependant on the Church; more than a third of their juriſdiction by the Tribunals of Biſhops &amp; Officials, who drew almoſt all cauſes to them, under the pretence, that there was ſomething mingled with them that reſpected the Church, the Sacraments, or the Conſcience; <hi>Laſtly,</hi> more than a third part of their Power, by the Uſurpations of the <hi>Popes,</hi> who have made Kings their Vaſſals a hundred ways. Beſides this, the <hi>Popes</hi> have particularly overthrown theſe three Kingdoms, that of the <hi>Greeks</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> that of the <hi>Lombards,</hi> &amp; that of <hi>Germany,</hi> which they have made dependant on the <hi>Roman</hi> Church. This little horn ſpeaks words of blaſphemy againſt God, exalts it ſelf above all that is called God, &amp; againſt the Kings of the Earth. <hi>It deſtroys the ſaints of the moſt high.</hi> That is to ſay, it perſecutes them even to blood. <hi>It thinks to change the Times &amp; the Law:</hi> it makes attempts againſt the divine laws: it deſtroys Gods Commands, &amp; diſpenſeth with them. It commands the adoration of images &amp; Creatures, which God forbids. It permits crimes which God abominates, &amp; againſt which he hath made ſevere laws.

                        <p>The judgment here ſpoken of is not the laſt judgment; God appears ſitting on a magnificent throne, not to judg the whole world, but to judg the Empire of the Beaſt, the fourth Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy in its Antichriſtian Period, &amp; to deal
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:95320:43"/>forth the various puniſhments that befall this Monarchy for 7 or 8 hundred years, to bring it to its end. This Fire, theſe Flames, theſe Wheels burning like fire, on which the throne moves, repreſent the greatneſs of thoſe puniſhments. And behold the Text of the 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi>.

As for this, it cannot be doubted by any that read the beginning of the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. Ch. with any attention.</p>
                        <p>To find out the myſtery of the ſeven ſeals &amp; the ſeven Trumpets, we muſt here again bring in that obſervation which we a little before made in the foregoing Ch. viz. that the <hi>Revelation</hi> contains enigmatically the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomy of the hiſtory of the fourth Monarchy, that is to ſay, of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire; a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy which according to <hi>Daniel's</hi> Prophecy muſt laſt till the coming of the Kingdom of J. Chriſt on the Earth, <hi>i. e.</hi> to the end of the reign of Antichriſt. It is clear that the Holy
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:95320:44"/>Spirit was to inſiſt only on this fourth Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, without conſidering the other ſtates &amp; Empires of the world, becauſe 'tis that only that <hi>Daniel</hi> ſpoke of after the three firſt Beaſts, whoſe reign was certainly paſt in <hi>St. John's</hi> time. Moreover, 'tis under this fourth Monarchy, &amp; in the extent of its dominions, that the Chriſtian Church hath receiv'd its ſeat &amp; its rule. That Chriſtianity that is found beyond the extent of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, is almoſt nothing. And therfore 'tis that the <hi>Counſells</hi> which were aſſembled from the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral parts of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire are called <hi>Oecumenical,</hi> as repreſenting the Univerſal Church. Now 'tis certain that all the Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies have a Mediate or an immediate Relation to the Church. So that they ought to inſiſt only on thoſe ſtates in which the Church hath been nouriſht &amp; brought up.</p>
                        <p>There is a third Reaſon why theſe Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies cannot be underſtood but of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe the reign of Antichriſt, which is the greateſt affair that happens in the Church, &amp; w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> muſt happen there, was to make a part &amp; a continuation of this <hi>Roman</hi> Empire. For Antichriſtianiſm is the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire continued. This principle which I was willing to repeat here becauſe of its importance, will ſerve to anſwer thoſe that ſay to us, How know you that the Prophecies of the <hi>Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> do not refer to <hi>China</hi> or <hi>Tartary?</hi> This objection doth not ſeem to me to be worthy of underſtanding perſons.</p>
                        <p>This being ſuppoſed that the <hi>Revelation</hi>
                           <pb n="39" facs="tcp:95320:44"/>enigmatically contains the hiſtory of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire continued,<note place="margin">The prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Cataſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phes hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening in the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire are iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinctly noted in the <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</hi>
                           </note> it muſt alſo be neceſſarily ſuppoſed that principal &amp; great Changes that happened in this Empire are deſcribed in large Characters, &amp; with ſome note of diſtinction in the <hi>Revelation.</hi> Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the H. Spirit would not act according to his profound wiſdom, if in making a hiſtory of an Empire, he ſhould omit to mark the great Cataſtrophes that are to happen therin, or if he ſhould hide them, &amp; make them to paſs without any character of diſtinction among the other leſs events.</p>
                        <p>We muſt therfore conſider what are the principal events that have happen'd in the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire. See here they are.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. The fall of Paganiſm, when the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperours became Chriſtians. This is ſo great an affair, that 'tis impoſſible to ſuppoſe that the Holy Spirit ſhould have taken no notice of it.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. The fall of the Temporal <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, when 'twas divided into ten Kingdoms.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. The erecting a new <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, or rather the continuation of the ſame under the rule of Antichriſt.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. The Birth of the <hi>Saracen</hi> Empire by the <hi>Arabians,</hi> that come to afflict the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire in its Eaſtern branch, <hi>i.e.</hi> the Empire of <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="5">5. The power of the <hi>Turks,</hi> that come to finiſh the deſtruction of the <hi>Greek</hi> branch of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, &amp; to lay deſolate the <hi>Latin</hi> Empire.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="40" facs="tcp:95320:45"/>
See the five great events that have changed the face of the word &amp; of the Empire. Wherefore I am perſwaded theſe muſt be found in the <hi>Revelation</hi> with Characters of diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Let us ſuppoſe therefore that in all the places where there is a notable diſtinction, there we muſt find one of theſe notable events.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Firſt</hi> diſtinction is found at the end of the ſixth ſeal. After the opening this ſeal, there happens a great Earthquake, the ſun is eclypſed, &amp; the moon becomes red as blood, the ſtars fall. Afterwards the viſion of the ſeals is interrupted by a new viſion that comes between, in which an Angel marks the elect among the twelve Tribes, twelve thouſand of every Tribe. After which the Holy Spirit returns to the ſeventh ſeal, under which nothing is done beſides the diſtribution of the ſeven Trumpets to ſeven Angells, that muſt ſound the ſucceſſively. 'Tis clear this is an <hi>Epocha,</hi> a point on which the H. Spirit would have our thoughts to dwell. This firſt Character of diſtinction muſt to all appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance be affixed to the firſt diſtinct event that happens in the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire; that is, the fall of <hi>Paganiſm.</hi> So that in the opening of the ſixth ſeal, we muſt find the fall of the <hi>Pagan Religion.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The <hi>Second</hi> very obſervable diſtinction is found at the fourth Trumpet. There the third part of the ſun is in like mannereclypſed, the moon &amp; the ſtars ſuffer the like diminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in their light. After which the proceſs
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:95320:45"/>of the Trumpets is interrupted by a new Viſion, <hi>viz.</hi> that of an Angel, that flies in the midſt of heaven, &amp; cries three time, <hi>Wo to the inhabitants of the Earth, becauſe of the three laſt Trumpets which are yet to ſound.</hi> This is an evident diſtinction; &amp; this ſecond diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on muſt ſignify to us the ſecond diſtinct event in the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, <hi>viz.</hi> its fall &amp; diviſion among ten Kings, which came to paſs after <hi>Valentinian</hi> the 3d. in the middle of the fifth Age.</p>
                        <p>The making a new Viſion &amp; a new Angel, crying <hi>Wo</hi> there times, go before the ſoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. Trumpet, is alſo a mark of diſtinction for that 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. Trumpet, which ſignifies to us that 'tis an event greatly diſtinguiſht in the hiſtory of the <hi>Roman</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire. And this third diſtinction can't be applied to any thing but the third notable event that befalls the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, <hi>viz.</hi> the Birth of the <hi>Saracen</hi> Empire by <hi>Mahomet</hi> &amp; his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors, that did ſo cruelly afflict the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, in the Empire of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> which was the greateſt &amp; the moſt noble part of theſe ten into which this Empire was divided.</p>
                        <p>The Empire of the <hi>Turks</hi> at the bottom is but a branch of the <hi>Arabian</hi> &amp; <hi>Saracen</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire. Wherfore it doth not deſerve ſo great a diſtinction as the other great events of which we have juſt now ſpoken. And yet the H. Spirit is content to diſtinguiſh it by a very long deſcription. The fifth &amp; ſixth Trumpet contain an entire Chapter, whereas the four firſt Trumpets were finiſht in 6. or 7. verſes.
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:95320:46"/>which ſignifies, that this fifth and ſixth Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet muſt be concerning great Affairs, and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils of a long duration.</p>
                        <p>As for that great Event, which was to hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen in the <hi>Roman Empire,</hi> which wereckon'd for the third; <hi>viz.</hi> the Erection of a new <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Empire,</hi> or the continuation of the ſame <hi>Empire</hi> under the new Name of the <hi>Pope</hi> and the <hi>Roman Church;</hi> 'tis ſo great an Affair, that the Holy Spirit would not bring it into the firſt part of the <hi>Revelation:</hi> He hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved it to make it the Subject of the ſecond part. 'Tis there that he explains largly and much more clearly the Birth, Progreſs, and Fall of this <hi>Antichriſtian Empire,</hi> that was to make the laſt Period of the fourth Beaſt.</p>
                        <p>According to this Syſtem, the five firſt Seals muſt bring the <hi>Roman Empire</hi> to the Fall of <hi>Paganiſm;</hi> i.e. to <hi>Conſtantine</hi>'s time. Under the ſixth Seal happens this Fall of <hi>Paganiſm.</hi> The Elect having been ſealed, and Silence ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been for half an hour, the four firſt Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets ſound, that muſt bring the <hi>Roman Empire</hi> to its Fall, to the taking of <hi>Rome</hi> by <hi>Genſerick</hi> after the death of <hi>Valentinian</hi> the 3d, the time wherein the Empire was torn in pieces in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ten Kingdoms.</p>
                        <p>The three laſt Trumpets are deſcribed by three Woes, <hi>Wo, Wo, Wo;</hi> that is to ſay, Wo not abſolutely, but to the fourth Monarchy; which ſignifies, that they muſt be diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed above all the reſt. The fifth Trumpet brings the <hi>Roman Empire</hi> afflicting, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes wearing it leſs and leſs to the ninth or
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:95320:46"/>tenth Age. The ſixth Trumpet brings and accompanies the <hi>Latin Roman Empire,</hi> or the Eccleſiaſtical one, in afflicting it in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to its end; that is to ſay, to the ſeventh Trumpet, which muſt bring the laſt miſery on the Inhabitants of the Antichriſtian World, and that is the Coming of the Kingdom of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt on the Earth. This ſixth Trumpet, that brings the <hi>Roman Eccleſiaſtical Empire</hi> to its end, begins about the tenth Age, and is ſubdivided into ſeven Vials in the 16<hi rend="sup">th</hi> chap. of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> juſt as the ſeventh Seal was divided into ſeven Trumpets. There are here two great Victories over the Empire of the Devil: The <hi>firſt</hi> is, The Fall of the ancient <hi>Paganiſm:</hi> The 2d is, The Fall of the <hi>New</hi> or the <hi>Antichriſtian Paganiſm.</hi> The <hi>firſt</hi> hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens immediately before the opening the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth Seal: The <hi>ſecond</hi> immediately before the ſounding of the laſt Trumpet.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Laſtly,</hi> After the ſeven Vials, that were to fall on the Beaſt, on his Throne, on his Subjects. on his Empire, comes the ſounding of the ſeventh Trumpet; and the ſounding of this laſt Trumpet, brings in and accompanies the Kingdom of Jeſus Chriſt on the Earth, in its whole duration, and ends with the end of the World.</p>
                        <p>Thus you haye the Syſtem of the ſeven Seals, and the ſeven Trumpets; let us now conſider the particulars, and we ſhall ſee that every thing exactly agrees with it.</p>

                           <p>The Explication of the Viſion of the Six Firſt Seals, according as it is in the ſixth Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Revelation.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>THe Opening of the Seals begins with the ſixth Chapter.</p>
                        <p>V. 1. <hi>I ſaw when the Lamb open'd one of the Seals, and I heard as it were the noiſe of Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and one of the four Beaſts ſaying, Come and ſee.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2. <hi>And I ſaw, and behold a White Horſe, and he that ſate on him had a Bow, and a Crown was given unto him, and he went forth conquering and to conquer.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>It muſt be obſerved, that the four firſt Seals make four Men to appear on Horſe-back; which ſignifies they are Perſons of Authority, and at the ſame time Warriours too. The Horſe is a living creature, deſigned for Fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and the Riding of Commanders and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors. We muſt obſerve alſo, that theſe four living Creatures call thoſe four Horſemen from the four quarters of the World, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their ſituation. The <hi>firſt</hi> of theſe li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Creatures was in the Eaſt; the 2d in the Weſt; the 3d in the South; and the 4th in the North.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>firſt</hi> living Creature, placed towards the Eaſt, cauſes a King to come forth from the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:95320:47"/>ſame quarter,<note place="margin">The firſt Horſman is <hi>Veſpaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> &amp; <hi>Titas</hi> his Son.</note> ſitting on a White Horſe; a Crown on his Head, and a Bow in his Hand: He comes forth to Conquer. <hi>Joſeph Mede, Henry More, Teſtard, Launay,</hi> and I know not how may more, would have this firſt Horſman to be the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who comes from <hi>Judea,</hi> which was eaſtward from <hi>Rome.</hi> Therefore this Horſman is called by the firſt living Creature, which was in the eaſtern quarter. But I can't be of that Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion;</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Firſt,</hi> Becauſe the Equipage of this Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man is not magnificent enough to repreſent Jeſus Chriſt. We need but conſult the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces where the Prophet makes Jeſus Chriſt to appear; the 1ſt, chap. the 10th, where he comes again to deliver a New Book to St. <hi>John;</hi> the 14th, where he comes to the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt and the Vintage; and <hi>laſtly,</hi> the 19th, where he returns in the equipage of a Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. But in all theſe places he is extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily magnificent, clothed with Fire, with the Light, with the Sun, with the Rain-bow, riding on the Clouds, having not one ſimple Crown, but many Diadems, and his Eyes ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting out Flames. Here there is nothing more plain &amp; mean: 'Tis a Man ſitting on a Horſe, with a Bow and a Crown. That which hath deceived Interpreters is, the Colour of the Horſe, <hi>White,</hi> which they have taken for an Emblem of Holineſs. But <hi>white</hi> is the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blem of <hi>Proſperity</hi> as well as of <hi>Holineſs.</hi> So that this ſignifies only the Succeſs and the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctories of him that ſits on the Horſe.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="46" facs="tcp:95320:48"/>
                           <hi>2dly,</hi> The Bow is not the Arms which the Holy Spirit uſually gives to Jeſus Chriſt; but a Sword, and a Sword coming out of his Mouth. A Bow doth but little execution in compariſon of a Sword: and this ſignifies the few Wars which this firſt Horſman ſhould make.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. <hi>Laſtly;</hi> Seeing what comes after by the conſent of Interpreters, whom I follow, we endeavour to find out <hi>Roman Emperors,</hi> why ſhould we put Jeſus Chriſt in the head of them? Why ſhould we make him the firſt of the four Emperors meant by theſe four Horſmen? 'Tis therefore much more reaſonable in this place, to find a <hi>Roman Emperor:</hi> One might here ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fily find <hi>Auguſtus</hi> the moſt happy of all men, that brought Peace, and ſhut the Temple of <hi>Ianus:</hi> But not to riſe ſo high, I think that we muſt ſeek <hi>Veſpaſian</hi> and his Son <hi>Titus</hi> in the firſt Horſman: He ſits on a White Horſe. The one and the other, <hi>Veſpaſian</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> were good Princes, under whom the Empire was pretty peaceable and quiet: They had not great Wars; therefore the Holy Spirit giveth them but a Bow. They come from the Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtern quarter, becauſe <hi>Veſpaſian</hi> was made and proclaimed Emperor when he was in the Eaſt. They come forth to conquer: 'tis with reſpect to the Nation of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> that was taken and burn; and the Temple, that was razed; and the People, that were led into Captivity by <hi>Titus</hi> under <hi>Veſpaſian.</hi> The <hi>Temple</hi> and the <hi>Moſaical Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,</hi> while they ſubſiſted, were a great Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacle
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:95320:48" rendition="simple:additions"/>to the Eſtabliſhment of the new Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. Therefore this deſtruction of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Temple &amp; Worſhip is a Victory in the behalf of J. Chriſt, which deſervd to be marked.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>And when he had open'd the ſeal,</hi>

                        <p>

                           <hi>Trajan</hi> &amp; <hi>Adrian,</hi> there were more than two millions of ſouls that died a violent death.

Now 'tis in civil wars that there is the greateſt effuſion of blood. This ſecond horſe comes out of the Weſtern quarter. <hi>Trajan</hi> was a Native of <hi>Spain,</hi> which was the Weſtern part of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire.</p>
                        <p>At the opening the third ſeal, there comes forth out of the South at the voice of the third living creature.</p>

Ch.</note> Here God cauſes his Elect to be ſealed, &amp; their number amounts to 144 thouſand. We ſhall ſee in the proceſs of this diſcourſe that 144 is a ſacred number, appointed to ſignify the Church; a number that ariſes from twelve multiplied by it ſelf. For the preſent it is ſufficient to obſerve, that God takes the time between the ſixth ſeal &amp; the firſt Trumpet to cauſe his elect to be ſealed, becauſe more unhappy, ſad, &amp; much more fatall times were at hand than the foregoing ones. In the ages of the <hi>Heathen</hi> Emperours &amp; under the Seals there were cruell perſecutions, men had ſuffer'd much in their bodies. But under the Trumpets muſt come the dark Kingdom of Antichriſt, wherin the ſouls of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi>-Church muſt be attack'd with Spiritual Temptations,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:95320:53"/>be ſwallowed up in Superſtition &amp; Idolatry; &amp; that in ſuch a manner that the number of the faithfull ſhould be almoſt as nothing. The 144 thouſand, ſignify the Church, the pure Church under Antichriſts reign. Now 144 thouſand are almoſt nothing in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of that innumerable multitude that is in the reign of Antichriſt. This little number therfore was to be ſealed, to the end that the deſtroying Angell of Spiritual <hi>Egypt</hi> might paſs over them, &amp; ſpare them. And they were to be ſealed before the ſeven Trumpets ſounded, becauſe the ruin of the Church was to happen under theſe ſeven Trumpets. Thus you have the whole myſtery of the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi>.

<pb n="61" facs="tcp:95320:55"/>is in it; pretending that this means ſome great perſon diſtinguiſht by his dignity as a king or an Emperour, or by his knowledg as a great Doctor. Therfore many by this ſtar underſtand a great Prophet. But 'tis not ſo. This muſt be explain'd with relation to the firſt Trumpet, &amp; we muſt know that this is but the ſequel of the hiſtory of the deſtruction of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire by the <hi>Barbarians.</hi> The firſt part of this deſtruction was but <hi>Hail mingled with Fire,</hi> a common ſtorm, &amp; ſuch as often happens in ſummer, wherin thunder &amp; lightning in hot countries are always mingled with the hail. But afterwards this inundation of the <hi>Barbarians</hi> increaſed in ſuch a manner, that it was no longer an ordinary ſtorm. There fell not only Fire mingled with Water &amp; Hail, this Storm becomes wholly pure fire, a fall of terrible Lightning, a true Mountain of Fire that fell on the <hi>Roman</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, &amp; over-whelm'd it. Afterwards the fire continued to fall on a third part, in truth no longer as a Mountain, but as a fire-brand, ſuch as the ſtars are that appear to fall in the air. See therfore here three fires. The <hi>Firſt</hi> is mingled with Hail. The ſecond is meer fire, &amp; great as a mountain. The third is as a great Lamp. The <hi>Firſt</hi> afflicts the Trees of <hi>Europe</hi> or of the third part of the World. The <hi>ſecond</hi> falls into the ſea, &amp; changes it into blood. The <hi>third</hi> falls on the rivers &amp; fountains, &amp; makes their waters bitter. This evidently ſignifies the three firſt degrees of the <hi>Barbarians</hi> invaſion. They come at <hi>Firſt</hi>
                           <pb n="62" facs="tcp:95320:56"/>like fire mingled with hail, which burns the trees, like a ſtorm that ſpoils the fruits of the Earth.

By that I underſtand the people of <hi>Italy,</hi> the taking of <hi>Rome</hi> by <hi>Alaric. Italy</hi> was in reſpect to the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire what the ſea is in reſpect to the rivers. The ſea is the center, &amp; the rivers are all round about it. The ſea is the gulf, &amp; the rivers come from all parts to pay their tribute to this gulf. <hi>Rome</hi> &amp; <hi>Italy</hi> was the midſt of the Empire. <hi>Rome</hi> was the ſea whither all the Provinces came to pay their tribute &amp; their riches. <hi>Alaric</hi> &amp; his <hi>Goths</hi> falls like a burning moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain on <hi>Italy,</hi> &amp; the city of <hi>Rome,</hi> he takes it, and ſacks it. <hi>This ſea becomes blood.

<pb n="63" facs="tcp:95320:56"/>they turned the Rivers and the Fountains in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Wormwood:</hi> i. e. They reduced the <hi>Roman</hi> Provinces into a bitter Servitude. And by reaſon of this, the name of <hi>Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood</hi> is given this laſt Fire; that is to ſay, this laſt Judgment and Puniſhment, leſs than the former, but yet ſo great as to make the people live in Bitterneſs. For the <hi>Goths</hi> ſpoiled them of their Lands &amp; Goods. See the Myſtery of the ſecond and third Trumpet. I have no need to give notice, that <hi>the third part of the Sea,</hi> and <hi>the third part of the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,</hi> ſignifie the Sea, and the Rivers of the third part of the World; <hi>i. e.</hi> of <hi>Europe:</hi> For I have given notice already of that once for all.

                        <p>THis fall of the Imperial dignity at <hi>Rome</hi> in the fourth Monarchy is a great affair. Therfore the H.

So that the ſenſe is, the <hi>Saracens</hi> by the permiſſion of God ſhould have a great power to torment &amp; harraſs the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire divided into ten Kingdoms, but not to deſtroy it. Indeed the <hi>Saracens</hi> tormented both <hi>Greeks</hi> &amp; <hi>Latins</hi> moſt cruelly.

But 'tis not ſo. We muſt obſerve, that the reign of the Locuſts is in the five months of the ſummer, <hi>May, June, July, Auguſt, September,</hi> &amp; that is their longeſt reign. For oftentimes they laſt not ſo long, becauſe ſometimes in the midſt of ſummer a great wind carries them away, or a long rain makes them burſt.

                        <p>That is to ſay, the heads of theſe Horſemen were like globes of fire, whence came forth flame and ſmoke. <hi>The heads of the horſes were as the heads of Lions, &amp; out of their mouths iſſued Fire, &amp; Smoke, &amp; Brimſtone.</hi> This Fire, this Smoke, and this Brimſtone, ſeem to be a deſcription of <hi>Gun-powder,</hi> and its effects.

Neither repented they of their Murders, nor
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:95320:63" rendition="simple:additions"/>of their Sorceries, nor of their Fornication, nor of their Thefts.</hi> This ſignifies to us, that the Periods of the ſixth Trumpet, and the ravages of the <hi>Turks,</hi> is that of the corruption of the Church in the fourth Monarchy, &amp; in the Antichriſtian Kingdom; a period, during which there reigned Idolatry, worſhipping of Demons, or ſecond Mediatory Gods, Images placed in the Temples &amp; Oratories, depravation of manners, by Poiſonings, Aſſaſſinations, Sodomies, Inceſts, Adulteries, and other impurities, Thefts, Robberies and Violent Dealings. And in truth, the <hi>Roman Church</hi> ſince the tenth Age, fell into ſuch ſhameful Idolatry, and ſuch horrible Corruption of Manners, that never was any thing like it ſeen in the Hiſtory of the World.

Another argument, that 'tis a Revelation wholly new, of another order. The firſt book con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the Deſtinies of the Empire, and this contains the Deſtinies of the Church. The firſt book was <hi>Written without &amp; within;</hi> by reaſon of the multitude of events that were to befall the fourth Monarchy, the adventures wherof God would foretel, until the coming of the fifth Monarchy; that is to ſay, the Kingdom of Jeſus Chriſt.

<pb n="79" facs="tcp:95320:64"/>For both <hi>the ſeven Spirits, &amp; the ſeven Thunders</hi> ſignify the divine Oracles: <hi>Spirits,</hi> becauſe of him that dictates them: <hi>Thunders,</hi> becauſe of their efficacy, becauſe they beat down to the ground, they aſtoniſh, &amp; they ſhake: <hi>Seven,</hi> becauſe of their perfection.

                        <p>
                           <hi>The ſeventh Angel ſounded,<note place="margin">Ch. 11.15.</note> and there were great Voices in Heaven, ſaying, The Kingdoms of this World are become the Kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Chriſt, and he ſhall reign for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever and ever.</hi>
                        </p>

<pb n="81" facs="tcp:95320:65"/>is, that the times afforded to <hi>Antichriſt</hi> ſhall be ended, &amp; ſhall be no more.

There ſhall not be neither time, nor times, nor half a time for Antichriſt. <hi>Time ſhall be no more</hi> for his reign, it ſhall be the time of his total deſtruction.</p>

                           <hi>Then the myſtery of God ſhall be finiſht, as he hath declared to his ſervants the Prophets: viz.</hi> The myſtery of this glorious reign of Jeſus Chriſt on the Earth, which hath been foretold by all the Prophets in ſo magnificent a manner, as we ſhall ſhew in the proceſs of this work, &amp; which <hi>Daniel</hi> ſaw ſo clearly, as to mark the time &amp; circumſtances of it.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>And the voice, which I heard from heaven,<note place="margin">v. 8,</note> ſpake to me again, &amp; ſaid, Go &amp; take the little book, which is open in the hand of the Angel, which ſtandeth upon the ſea &amp; upon the Earth.</hi>

                        <p>
                           <hi>And I went unto the Angel,<note place="margin">v. 9,</note> &amp; ſaid unto him, give me the little book. And he ſaid unto me, take it, &amp; eat it up, &amp; it ſhall make thy belly bitter, but it ſhall be in thy mouth ſweet as Honey.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The voice which he heard from Heaven, is the ſame as ſpoke to him in the beginning of the book; <hi>I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day, &amp; heard behind me a great voice as of a Trumpet, ſaying, I am</hi> Alpha &amp; Omega, <hi>the Firſt &amp; the Laſt.</hi> And this alſo ſhews, that
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:95320:66"/>this here is a new prophecy, &amp; not the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuation of the firſt. For the ſame voice of God the Father, that began the <hi>Firſt Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,</hi> returns &amp; begins the <hi>ſecond;</hi> as the ſame Jeſus Chriſt alſo appears again a ſecond time. Saint <hi>John</hi> receives the book from the hand of the Angel, that is to ſay, of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, becauſe 'tis he that ſends the Prophets, &amp; that inſpires them by his Spirit. This little book is <hi>Saveet</hi> in Saint <hi>John's Mouth,</hi> becauſe the Spirit of prophecy &amp; the glory of being the mouth of God from heaven, pleaſes the inclination of men that love honour. But this little book <hi>Made his belly bitter,</hi> becauſe that after having reflected on the events which he was about to fore-tell, after having digeſted &amp; conſider'd them in his own breaſt, he found them ſo dreadful, that they filled his ſoul with ſorrow.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>And he ſaid unto me,</hi>

                        <p>Theſe words do no longer leave any cauſe of doubting, whether this be a new prophecy, &amp; not a continuation of the <hi>Firſt.</hi> Thou muſt make a <hi>Second</hi> Prophecy to Kings, People &amp; Nations; &amp; wheras what thou haſt prophecied to them, reſpected their <hi>Temporal ſtate;</hi> for the future that which thou ſhalt foretell them, reſpects their <hi>Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual ſtate</hi> &amp; the things of <hi>Religion.</hi>

                        </argument>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">The hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Church is not to be found but in the laſt eleven Chapters of the Apoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lypſe.</note>WE muſt not ſeek for the <hi>Hiſtory</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> in the Firſt Nine chapters of the <hi>Apocalypſe. Joſeph Mede</hi> is the firſt that hath diſcover'd, that the <hi>Apocalypſe</hi> conſiſts of two bodies of <hi>Revelations,</hi> meant by two <hi>Books;</hi> the firſt of which we find in the beginning of the fifth Chapter, v. 1. <hi>And I ſaw in the right hand of him that ſate on the throne, a book written within, &amp; on the back ſide, ſealed with ſeven ſeals.</hi> The other we find in the 10. Chap. v. 2. <hi>And he had in his hand a little book open, &amp; he ſet his right foot upon the ſea, &amp; his left foot on the Earth.</hi> It is plain that theſe two Books are two bodies of <hi>Revelations,</hi> perfect in their kind, &amp; different each from the other; that both the one &amp; the other run through all, &amp; reach to all the times from the beginning of the <hi>Revelation</hi> of <hi>St. John,</hi> even to the end of the World. One cannot imagine any thing more reaſonable than this, that the <hi>Firſt Book</hi> contains the deſtinies of the <hi>World,</hi> the <hi>Empire,</hi> &amp; the <hi>Church</hi> alſo, in reſpect to her Temporal, &amp; as far as ſhe is a part of the World. The <hi>Second Book</hi> contains the deſtinies of the <hi>Church</hi> properly taken as a Church, &amp; diſtinguiſht from the
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:95320:67"/>ſocieties of the World. This is a much better notion than that of Mr. <hi>de Launay,</hi> who tells us, that the firſt book contains the <hi>Hiſtory</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> &amp; the ſecond that of the <hi>Goſpel.</hi> What can be the adventures of the <hi>Goſpell</hi> diſtinct from thoſe of the <hi>Church?</hi> How can thoſe <hi>Prophecies</hi> that reſpect the Eſtabliſhment &amp; the ruin of <hi>Antichriſt</hi> be applied to the book of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> unleſs it be in a very indirect manner? For theſe events do directly reſpect the <hi>Church</hi> &amp; not the book of the Holy Scriptures.</p>
                        <p>That which God ſaith to <hi>St. John,</hi> after he had cauſed him to ſwallow the little book of the 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi>.<note place="margin">v. 11.</note> Chapter, <hi>Thou muſt propheſy again before many Peoples, &amp; Nations, &amp; Tongues, &amp; Kings.</hi> Theſe words, I ſay, do plainly ſhew, that this is a <hi>Prophecy</hi> wholly new, which doth begin, and paſs over again all the periods of time. This being ſo, that is to ſay, the firſt book included in the 5. 6. 7. 8. and 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. Chapters, containing the deſtinies of the <hi>Roman Empire,</hi> and the various changes that were to befall it even to the time of its utter ruin by the revolt of the <hi>ton Kings,</hi> it is evident that they are greatly miſtaken, that endeavour to find the <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>Anti-chriſt</hi> in the <hi>Star</hi> of the 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. Chapter called <hi>Wormwood.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>It is true, that in the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. Ch. we find, the viſion of the 144. thouſand perſons that were <hi>Sealed,</hi> who do belong to the <hi>Hiſtory</hi> of the <hi>Church.</hi> For theſe are they that have not defiled their garments with the <hi>Idolatries</hi>
                           <pb n="85" facs="tcp:95320:67"/>of <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> nor partaken of his fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Theſe are the ſame with the <hi>two Witneſſes</hi> of the 11<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. Chapter, that propheſy clothed in ſack-cloth for 1260 days, during the reign of <hi>Anti-Chriſt &amp; Babylon.</hi> The H. Ghoſt hath placed theſe 144 thouſand <hi>Sealed</hi> perſons in the deſtinies of the <hi>Empire,</hi> immediatly after the opening the firſt ſix ſeals, &amp; before the opening of the ſeventh, becauſe the ſeventh <hi>Seal</hi> was to be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divided into ſeven <hi>Trumpets,</hi> which do reach even to the end of <hi>Antichriſt's Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire:</hi> Trumpets that were to contain the horrible corruption of the <hi>Church,</hi> the Birth and Progreſs of her <hi>Idolatries.</hi> It was therfore very reaſonable to take notice of thoſe whom God intended to exempt from thoſe corruptions, before the opening of the ſeventh <hi>Seal,</hi> which was to bring ſo many evills on the <hi>Church,</hi> as well as upon the <hi>World.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This in my opinion being certain, that the deſtinies of the <hi>Church</hi> do not begin be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the 11<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. Chapter, &amp; are proſecuted even to the end, it will be neceſſary to conſider the <hi>Chronology</hi> &amp; the <hi>Hiſtory</hi> of theſe twelve Chapters, from the 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. to the 22<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. &amp; the laſt.</p>
                        <p>As for the <hi>Chronology, St. Iohn</hi> begins his <hi>Prophecy</hi> concerning the <hi>Church,</hi> either from the beginning of the <hi>Chriſtian Aera,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">The Chru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Church in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calypſe muſt be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into three Periods.</note> i.e. from the birth of the Saviour of the World; or at leaſt from the time in which he prophecied, which was in the reign of <hi>Trajan.</hi> This duration of the <hi>Church</hi> from Jeſus Chriſt's time is divided
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:95320:68"/>into three general <hi>Periods.</hi> The <hi>Firſt</hi> is that of the <hi>Chriſtian Church</hi> in the four firſt Ages, which were thoſe of her purity; the ſecond is that of her <hi>Corruption, Idolatries &amp; An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſtianiſm,</hi> that was to endure 1260 years, at the concluſion whereof an end muſt be put to the <hi>Babyloniſh Empire.</hi> The third <hi>Period</hi> contains the <hi>reign</hi> of a <hi>thouſand years,</hi> during which the Church muſt have peace, &amp; after which muſt follow the <hi>laſt judgment.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The firſt of theſe <hi>Periods</hi> is the ſhorteſt, not laſting above 3 or 400 years. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>St. Iohn</hi> doth not ſtay much upon it. This is the <hi>Period</hi> which he deſcribes in a few words in the beginning of the 11<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. Ch. <hi>And there was given to me a reed like a rod, &amp; the Angel ſtood, ſaying, riſe &amp; meaſure the temple of God, &amp; the Altar, &amp; them that worship therin. But the court which is without the Temple, leave out, &amp; meaſure it not, for it is given to the Gentiles, &amp; the holy city ſhall they tread under foot forty &amp; two Months.</hi> All the world is agreed, that the <hi>Temple</hi> built by <hi>Solomon</hi> according to the orders of God, was an Emblem of the <hi>Church.</hi> This <hi>Temple</hi> had two <hi>Courts,</hi> an inward and an outward one. Here the H. Ghoſt repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents the whole duration of the <hi>Chriſtian Church</hi> by the extent of this <hi>Temple</hi> and its <hi>Courts.</hi> Nothing is more proper to ſhadow forth the extent of time than the extent of place. This inward <hi>Court</hi> that was meaſured by <hi>St. John,</hi> together with the <hi>Altar</hi> &amp; them that worſhip therin, is the firſt <hi>Period</hi> of
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:95320:68" rendition="simple:additions"/>the <hi>Church,</hi> the Ages which we call the happy times of the <hi>Church</hi> which reach to the end of the <hi>fourth Age,</hi> about 360 or 380 <hi>Years.</hi> The reſt of the <hi>Chriſtian Churches</hi> duration till the reign of the 1000 years is ſhadowed forth by the outward <hi>Court,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward court is an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blem of the pure Church, &amp; the out ward court an Emblem of the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted Church.</note> which God leaves to the <hi>Gentiles</hi> to tread under food 42 <hi>Monthes.</hi> This is the <hi>Chriſtian Church</hi> turn'd <hi>Pagan</hi> by the admiſſion of ſecondary <hi>Deities,</hi> mediating <hi>Spirits, &amp; Images.</hi> Here is one thing that deſerves to be carefully taken notice of: between the duration of the <hi>Church</hi> in its purity and in its corruption, there is exactly the very ſame proportion as there between the greatneſs &amp; the extent of the inward <hi>Court</hi> &amp; the outward one. Thoſe that have taken the pains to compute the extent of theſe two <hi>Courts</hi> according to that deſcription of them, that we meet with in the <hi>Iewiſh</hi> Authors, both ſacred &amp; prophanc, find that the proportion of the inward <hi>Court</hi> to that without,<note place="margin">V. Villal-pand. in Ezech.</note> is the ſame with that of one to three &amp; a half. Now there is the very ſame proportion between the duration of the <hi>Church</hi> in its corruption &amp; in its purity. The corrupt <hi>Church</hi> laſts 42. <hi>Months,</hi> that is three years &amp; a <hi>Half:</hi> according to which the <hi>Church</hi> in its purity muſt not have laſted above one prophetique year, which contains 360 <hi>Days,</hi> that is to ſay 360 <hi>Years.</hi> Indeed the <hi>Church</hi> did continue in its purity juſt ſo long. About the year 360 the unhappy ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtions about <hi>Reliques,</hi> &amp; the <hi>invocation of Saints</hi> began to creep into the <hi>Church;</hi> which
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:95320:69" rendition="simple:additions"/>quickly degenerated into <hi>Idolatry.</hi> Thus the reign of <hi>Anti-Chriſtian Idolatry</hi> hath laſted three times &amp; a half, hath l<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

'Tis no longer a <hi>Beaſt</hi> with ſeven <hi>Heads</hi> &amp; ten <hi>Horns;</hi> 'tis no longer the <hi>Beaſt</hi> with two <hi>Horns;</hi> 'tis <hi>Spiritual Babylon.</hi> But this <hi>Babylon</hi> is the very ſame thing as the firſt &amp; the ſecond <hi>Beaſt.

                        </p>
                        <p>The ſeven foregoing verſes are a preparation for this great fall; &amp; the following ones to the end of the Chapter are a deſcription of the ruin of <hi>Babel.</hi> The <hi>Man</hi> that ſits on the white cloud,<note place="margin">v. 14.</note> is <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> The ſickle that is put in firſt among the corn to mow it down, and afterwards into the vintage to cut down the grapes, are the two degrees of <hi>Babylons</hi> fall, which we ſhall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards explain.

                        </p>
                        <p>The H. Ghoſt thought it not enough to have foretold the fall of the <hi>Babyloniſh Empire</hi> in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,<note place="margin">Chap. 15.</note> he will alſo inſtruct us in the ſteps by which it muſt paſs in falling. And as this is a great affair, the viſion of the 15<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. <hi>Chapter</hi> is employed to prepare mens <hi>Spirits</hi> for it. The ſeven <hi>Vialls</hi> of the wrath and vengeance of God, that muſt overwhelm the <hi>Babyloniſh Empire,</hi> are diſtributed
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:95320:75"/>to ſeven diſtinct <hi>Angels,</hi> to pour them out at diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent times.</p>
                        <p>The 16. Chap. contains the pouring forth of theſe <hi>Vialls,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Chap. 16.</note> which are the ſeveral puniſhments by which the <hi>Empire</hi> of the <hi>Beaſt</hi> is afflicted, till it be entirely brought to nothing. And theſe ſeven <hi>Vials</hi> contain all the time of the fall of the <hi>Babyloniſh Empire:</hi> Of this we will treat in a particular <hi>Chapter</hi> by it ſelf afterwards. It is enough to know that this Chapter leads the afflicted <hi>Church</hi> to the very point of her delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. And thus you have the whole <hi>Hiſtory</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> during the 1260 <hi>Years.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But becauſe theſe things had been expreſſed in figurative terms,<note place="margin">Chap. 17.</note> and prophetical ſymbols of <hi>Beaſis, Horns, Harveſt, Vintage</hi> &amp; <hi>Vialls,</hi> God will explain theſe things in terms leſs figurative &amp; more intelligible. Therfore the 17<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. Ch. is ſpent in explaining the <hi>Viſions</hi> of the two <hi>Beaſis,</hi> to give us to underſtand, that the <hi>Beaſis</hi> ſignify an <hi>Empire,</hi> that the ten <hi>Horus</hi> are <hi>ten Kings;</hi> that theſe <hi>ten Kings</hi> out of weakneſs and complaiſance would give their power to the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> and that at laſt they would ruin him, &amp; take away that power they had formerly given him.</p>
                        <p>As in the 17<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. Ch. the H. Ghoſt declares the eſtabliſhment &amp; the progreſs of the <hi>Babyloniſh Empire</hi> in a more clear and leſs figurative manner than he had done in the 13<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. Chap. in the like manner in the 18<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. Chap. he gives us the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of the ruin of this <hi>Babylon,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Chap. 18.</note> more largely &amp; more clearly; more largely I ſay, &amp; more clearly than he had done in the 14<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. Chap.

The 19<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. Chap. is as it were a recapitulation of all that reſpects the ruin of <hi>Babylon.</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Chap. 19.</note> Therin <hi>J.

'Tis the ſame thing we met with before in the 14. Chap. at the end of the 16. at the end of the 17. and throughout the whole 18. Chap. The frequent repetition of the ſame thing is to note the certainty of it.</p>
                        <p>The three following <hi>Chapters,</hi> viz. the 20, 21 and 22. contain the <hi>Hiſtory</hi> of the third &amp; laſt general <hi>Period</hi> of the duration of <hi>Chriſtianity.</hi> It is <hi>the reign of J.

But ſeeing that hereafter we ſhall have occaſion carefully to examin them, it is not neceſſary to ſtay about them at preſent.</p>
                        <p>So much ſuffices for a general Idea both of the <hi>Chronology</hi> &amp; of the <hi>Hiſtory,</hi> of the twelve laſt Chapters of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> which contain the deſtinies of the <hi>Church.</hi>

It appears by this account of the points wherin the <hi>Papiſts</hi> are agreed to, that we are all of the ſame mind firſt, as to all thoſe places whence the main ſtrokes of <hi>Antichriſts picture</hi> are to be taken; and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, as to almoſt all the main ſtrokes of which this <hi>Picture</hi> is to be compoſed. It will appear afterwards, that theſe truths wherin our enemies are agreed with us, do quite overthrow thoſe things wherin they differ from us.</p>

Theſe five points being proved to be falſe, all the reſt conſequently will be ſo too. Theſe are the only things that are worth our taking notice of. For as for the reſt, that <hi>Antichriſt</hi> muſt be of the <hi>Tribe of Dan,</hi> born in an obſcure place; that he ſhall cauſe fire to come down from Heaven; that he ſhall feign himſelf dead, that he may counterfeit a Reſurrection; that <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> muſt come out of that earthly Paradiſe, where they are kept in reſerve; to fight with him; that he is to kill them; that they muſt riſe on the fourth day: All this I ſay is ſo fabulous, that it would be an injury to ſo underſtanding an Age as ours, formally to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute ſuch idle viſions, and ſo wholly deſtitute of any foundation.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">All may be reduced to the ſingle queſtion-about the three years and a half of <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſts</hi> dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</note>This controverſy may be reduced to one only point; and it is that of the duration of the <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian Empire.</hi> If it can be made very plain and certain, that the <hi>three years and a half</hi> of the duration of this <hi>Empire</hi> muſt not be taken for <hi>natural years,</hi> but for <hi>three prophetical years and a half,</hi> it will alſo be very certain, that all which the <hi>Papiſts</hi> ſay concerning <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> is falſe. For if the <hi>Antichriſtian Empire</hi> muſt laſt 1260 <hi>years, Antichriſt</hi> can never be only one ſingle <hi>man;</hi> ſeeing there is no <hi>man</hi> that hath lived, doth, or can live 1260. <hi>years.</hi> Nor will it be more true, that <hi>Antichriſt</hi> muſt not come, but juſt at the end of the World: For the duration of
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:95320:80"/>1260. <hi>years,</hi> and the end of the World are not one and the ſame thing: Neither will it be more true, that the <hi>Goſpel</hi> muſt have been preached in all the Nations of the World, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the coming of <hi>Antichriſt.</hi> For there is no <hi>propheſy</hi> that ſaith, or doth ſo much as inſinuate, that the <hi>Goſpel</hi> muſt be preached every where 1260. <hi>years,</hi> before the laſt coming of our <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> It will be as falſe, that <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt</hi> is not to come, till after the total ruin of the <hi>German Empire.</hi> For although we do not exactly know the time the coming of our <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> however this is held for certain, that the <hi>World</hi> is not to endure yet two or 3000. <hi>years</hi> longer, as it muſt do if <hi>Antichriſt</hi> be not yet como, and muſt reign 1260. <hi>years.</hi> For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides theſe 1260. <hi>years,</hi> we muſt find out a 1000. <hi>years</hi> of peace for the <hi>Church,</hi> before the end of the World. Neither will it be true, that <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt</hi> muſt be a falſe <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> received by the <hi>Jews,</hi> an enemy of <hi>God</hi> and of all <hi>Religion.</hi> For God would not ſuffer that, His wiſdom would not permit it. There is nothing in the Scripture that gives us any ground to preſume, that an Infidel, an open enemy of Jeſus Chriſt, and of his Religion, muſt remain maſter of all the World for 1260. <hi>years.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>'Tis plain therefore, this is the principal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy, on which all the reſt do depend. Let this be remembred: We will handle this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy in its proper place.

                        <p>WE have ſeen in the fore-going Chapter, that the names of the <hi>Antichriſtian Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire</hi> are <hi>Egypt, Sodom, Babylon;</hi> and that its <hi>Characters</hi> ſignified by theſe names, are <hi>Tyranny, Pride, Cruelty, extream corruption of manners, Idolatry</hi> and <hi>Paganiſm.</hi> We have fixed this <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylonish Empire</hi> every where, where theſe <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters</hi> are to be found. We have reckon'd the <hi>Papiſm</hi> for the center and the body, <hi>Rome</hi> for the capital place, and the <hi>Pope</hi> for the head. We muſt now prove, that theſe <hi>Characters</hi> do per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly agree to the <hi>Papiſm,</hi> to its capital place, and its head. But we do pretend, that as to us, this thing hath been already done: we have done it in our <hi>juſt prejudices againſt Popery,</hi> aſwell as we are able; and indeed that whole work is but a proof of this propoſition, that <hi>all the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters of the Antichriſtian Empire do agree to the Papiſm.</hi>

                        <p>We therfore may juſtly ſay, the <hi>Roman Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire</hi> is deſtroyed, and was aboliſht when the <hi>Goths,</hi> the <hi>Vandals,</hi> and the <hi>Huns</hi> rent it in pieces, and divided it into ſo many parts, took away the rule from the <hi>City of Rome,</hi> and made it the chief <hi>City</hi> only of a part of that ancient <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire.</hi> And indeed, 'tis then, that the <hi>Antichriſtian Empire</hi> was born, or at leaſt began to be <hi>Revealed,</hi> that is to ſay, to become ſenſible; and this was in the fifth <hi>Age.</hi>

'Tis found above all in the 13<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. Chapter. Two <hi>Beaſts</hi> are ſeen in this Chapter. We ſhall immediately examin both the one and the other, following the Text word for word.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>V.</hi> 1. <hi>And I ſaw a Beaſt riſe out of the ſea, having ſeven Heads and ten Horns, and upon his Horns ten crowns, and upon his Heads the name of Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2. <hi>And the beaſt, which I ſaw, was like unto a Leopard, and his feet were as the feet of a Bear, and his mouth as the mouth of a Lion; and the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon gave him his power, and his ſeat, and great authority.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>There is no need that I ſhould obſerve here,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:95320:95"/>that in the ſtyle of the Prophets a <hi>Beaſt</hi> ſignifies an <hi>Empire.</hi>
                           <note place="margin">A beaſt ſignifies a worldly Empire, enemy of God.</note> All the world knows it, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes it. It muſt only be noted, that a <hi>Beaſt</hi> ſignifies an <hi>Empire</hi> that is worldly, terreſtrial, and an enemy to God. The <hi>Kingdom</hi> of God and of Jeſus Chriſt, that muſt be given to the Saints after the fourth <hi>Monarchy,</hi> is never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented under the image of a <hi>Beaſt.</hi> The <hi>Beaſt</hi> that appears here, is the fourth <hi>Monarchy,</hi> which we have ſeen deſcribed in the text of the ſeventh Chapter of <hi>Daniel.</hi> The Prophet had ſaid, that <hi>it was diverſe from all the other Beaſts.</hi> And <hi>Saint John</hi> in the explication of it ſaith, that it was compoſed of the ſhape of a <hi>Lion,</hi> a <hi>Leopard,</hi> and a <hi>Bear;</hi> wheras the fore-going <hi>Beaſts</hi> had but one ſimple ſhape. The <hi>Firſt</hi> was as a <hi>Lion</hi> with the wings of an Eagle. The <hi>ſecond</hi> was as a <hi>Bear,</hi> and the <hi>third</hi> as a <hi>Leopard.</hi> But this fourth <hi>Monarchy</hi> hath all the ſtrength, and all the advantages of the tree others together. 'Tis couragious and ſtrong as a <hi>Lion.</hi> It had the ſwiftneſs of a <hi>Leopard</hi> in its conqueſts. It hath the firmneſs of a <hi>Bear,</hi> whoſe large feet make a firm baſis for its whole body.</p>
                        <p>The Holy Spirit lays before the Prophets eyes this <hi>Roman Monarchy</hi> whole and entire,<note place="margin">Why the fourth Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy appears en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire in the Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> about a third part of it was already paſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this <hi>Monarchy</hi> was to be the ſubject, on which all the great events were to turn. And to know and object well, it muſt not be ſhewn by pieces, but all entire. So that 'tis reaſonable the Prophet ſhould ſee this <hi>Beaſt,</hi> or this <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy,</hi> in its whole extent. <hi>He riſeth out of the Sea.</hi> This is not what was ſaid in the eleventh Chapter, <hi>he riſeth out of the bottomleſs pit.</hi> The bottomleſs pit and the ſea are not the ſame thing.
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:95320:95" rendition="simple:additions"/>The bottomleſs pit is Hell. Here the ſea ſignifies a great number of people. The <hi>Roma Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy</hi> roſe from the midſt of the people, as a mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter that ſhould riſe out of the ſea. 'Tis becauſe it was eſtabliſht with a terrible havock, ſuch as a hideous monſter, that ſhould riſe out of the ſea, and of an enormous greatneſs would cauſe, making the waves to foam, blowing the water with his noſtrills, and ſending out terrible bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowings. 'Tis the emblem of the manner; wherby the <hi>Roman Empire</hi> was eſtabliſht.</p>
                        <p>This Beaſt <hi>hath ſeven Heads.</hi> The Spirit explains this of ſo many <hi>Kings,</hi> and ſo many mountains. <hi>The ſeven heads are ſeven Kings, and ſeven Mountains.</hi> See here the <hi>Character</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> together with its <hi>Empire.</hi> It ſits on ſeven <hi>Heads,</hi> that is to ſay, on ſeven <hi>Mountains;</hi> and it had ſeven <hi>Kings,</hi> that is to ſay, ſeven forms of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign Governments.</hi> We have already reckon'd them up in the foregoing Chapter.

But in a few words, I can't doubt, but that they who have reckoned the numeral power of the letters of the name of the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> and of its <hi>Pope,</hi> have hit upon the ſenſe of the Prophecy. <hi>'Tis the number of his name;</hi> that is to ſay, expreſſely contained in his name. <hi>'Tis a number of a man;</hi> that is to ſay, 'tis a number that muſt be underſtood according as men do count; not in a prophetical and Myſterious ſtyle, which oftentimes under one number hides another unknown number. But in what language muſt we count the numeral letters of the name of the <hi>Beaſt?</hi> 'Tis eaſy to determin that. The <hi>Prophecies</hi> muſt be explained according to the language of the <hi>Prophets.</hi> There are two languages of the Prophets, <hi>Hebrew</hi> and <hi>Greek.</hi> Look for the name of the <hi>Roman Church</hi> in theſe two languages. In <hi>Hebrew</hi> you will find <hi>Romiyth,</hi> and in <hi>Greek Lateinos.</hi> The firſt ſignifies the <hi>Roman Beaſt,</hi> or the <hi>Roman Church.</hi> The ſecond ſignifies the <hi>Emperour</hi> or the <hi>Latin Pope.</hi> And in the one and in the other there is exactly <hi>ſix hundred threeſcore and ſix.</hi>

Wherers the <hi>number</hi> 144. that ſignifies the <hi>Church,</hi> hath for its <hi>ſquare root</hi> the number 12, which is the ſacred number of the <hi>Patriarchs</hi> and <hi>Apoſtles.</hi> As for the remainder of 41, which is added to the number 625, ariſing from 25. mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied by it ſelf, he gives many ingenious rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for it, and which do deſerve to be conſulted on the place.<note place="margin">Why God adds a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of 41, to 625. to make up 666.</note> 
                           <hi>Ioſeph Mede,</hi> who is a great Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter in theſe ſorts of things, gives a very authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique approbation of this diſcovery. And it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be denied, but that it is very ingenious. But I confeſs, I find it a little profound. However, I would not deny, that it is the intention of the Holy Spirit. And it may be this is the meaning of the Prophecy, <hi>Here is wiſdom, let him that hath underſtanding count the number of the beaſt: For underſtanding</hi> may ſignify the wiſdom of this World, i. e. <hi>Arithmetique,</hi> which makes a part of humane ſciences, to ſignify, that to penetrate into this myſtery of the <hi>number</hi> 666. we muſt uſe the rules of <hi>Arithmetique,</hi> and ſeek for the <hi>ſquare root</hi> of this number 666.</p>
                        <p>Beſides, though one ſhould admit all the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations of <hi>Potter as ſolid,</hi> this would not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the common hypotheſis, which is, that the <hi>number</hi> 666. alludes to the names of <hi>Lateinos</hi> and <hi>Romiyth,</hi> in which this number is ſo preciſely found. For the product of 25. multiplied by it ſelf, makes but 625. Why did the Holy Spirit add a remainder of 41? why did he not leave the round account of 625, the product of the <hi>ſquare root</hi> 25? or why, reſolving to add a remainder, did he not add 20 to make it 645, or 30 to make it 655; but adds preciſely a remainder of 41 to make it 666? I am perſwaded, it was to make up the ſum contained in the names <hi>Lateinos</hi> and <hi>Romiyth.</hi>
                           <pb n="155" facs="tcp:95320:102"/>So that it is ſtill true, that the <hi>number</hi> 666 re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers immediately to the name of the <hi>Antichriſtian Empire.</hi> But I will not deny, but that beſides this, there are other myſteries in it; and thoſe of <hi>Potter</hi> are very well contrived, and very proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. To ſtrengthen them,<note place="margin">Two conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations to ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then the opinion of <hi>Potter,</hi>
                           </note> theſe two conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions may be added; Firſt, That the number 12. ſignifying very naturally the <hi>whole Goſpel mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry,</hi> becauſe of the <hi>twelve Apoſtles,</hi> who are the firſt Miniſters of the <hi>Goſpel;</hi> the number 144. muſt alſo naturally ſignify the body of the whole <hi>Church;</hi> becauſe as the number 144. is produced by the multiplication of 12, in like manner the body of the <hi>Church</hi> is formed by the multiplication, which is produced by the <hi>Goſpel miniſtry,</hi> of which the <hi>twelve Apoſtles</hi> are the founders. On the other hand, as the <hi>number</hi> 666 is produced by the multiplication of 25, ſo the <hi>Empire</hi> of the <hi>Papiſm</hi> and of the <hi>Beaſt</hi> is produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by the multiplication, cauſed by his falſe <hi>miniſtry</hi> and by his falſe <hi>Paſtors,</hi> who originally were 25.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Seoond,</hi> The other conſideration is, that the Holy Spirit ſignifies the <hi>Goſpel miniſtry</hi> by 12, and the body of the <hi>Goſpel Church</hi> by 144. And on the contrary, the body of the <hi>Empire</hi> of the <hi>Papiſm</hi> by 666. to teach us the proportion that is between the falſe <hi>Church</hi> and the true. 144 is but the fifth part of 666.

'Tis the ſame thing under leſs obſcure <hi>aenigma's.</hi> In the 13<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chapter we have ſeen two <hi>Beaſts.</hi> Here only one of them is ſeen; but by way of amends for that, here is a <hi>woman</hi> ſeen, ſitting on the <hi>beaſt.</hi> So that here are two perſons.</p>

                           <hi>and I ſaw a woman ſit upon a ſcarlet-coloured beaſt, full of names of blaſphemy, having ſeven heads and ten horns.</hi> See here the firſt <hi>Beaſt</hi> of the 13<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chapter, <hi>i. e.</hi> the <hi>Roman Empire.</hi> The <hi>Beaſt</hi> is of a <hi>ſcarlet</hi> colour.

In the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Chapter it ſhall be proved, that theſe two <hi>Beaſts,</hi> this here, and that of the thirteenth Chapter, are one and the ſame <hi>Beaſt.</hi> On this <hi>Beaſt</hi> ſits <hi>a woman:</hi> See here a thing that ſpeaks, and that loudly. <hi>A woman:</hi> who doth not ſee, that this ſignifies <hi>a Church?</hi> Did any ever ſee in the Prophets an Empire, <hi>as</hi> an Empire repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented under the image of <hi>a woman?</hi> Is not this the Emblem, which the Holy Spirit uſeth every

                           <note place="margin">Why there is not a Woman ſitting on the Beaſt of the 13th Chap. as there is on that of the 17th.</note>Theſe ſo exact and perfect reſemblances plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhew, that theſe two <hi>Beaſts</hi> are one. But why is there a <hi>Woman</hi> ſeen ſitting on the ſecond <hi>Beaſt,</hi> and none upon the firſt? we have already hinted the reaſon. In the thirteenth Chap. there are two <hi>Beaſts,</hi> which by the confeſſion of all Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters, even the <hi>popish</hi> ones themſelves, ſignify one and the ſame thing; only the <hi>Beaſt</hi> with the ſeven <hi>heads</hi> ſignifies the <hi>Empire;</hi> and the <hi>Beaſt</hi>
                           <pb n="176" facs="tcp:95320:108"/>with two <hi>horns</hi> like thoſe of a <hi>Lamb,</hi> ſignifies the <hi>Religion.</hi> And theſe two <hi>Beaſts</hi> together ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify the <hi>Roman Empire</hi> raiſed up under the name of the <hi>Church,</hi> and under the outſide of <hi>Religion.</hi> In the 17<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chap. the ſecond <hi>Beaſt,</hi> which ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies the <hi>Religion,</hi> doth not appear; but in the place thereof appears a <hi>Woman</hi> riding upon the <hi>Beaſt</hi> to ſignify the <hi>Religion.</hi> And this for the greater clearneſs, becauſe the ſeventeenth Chap. is an explication of the viſions of the thirteenth. For the greater clearneſs, I ſay; for the corrupted <hi>Church</hi> is much more clearly ſignified by a <hi>Woman,</hi> than by a <hi>Beaſt.</hi> In all the Scripture, the <hi>Church</hi> is always repreſented to us as a Spouſe, and a <hi>Woman;</hi> and the corrupt and <hi>idolatrous Church,</hi> as a debauch'd <hi>Woman,</hi> and an <hi>Adultereſs.</hi> This is too well known to need any proof. Behold therefore this corrupted <hi>Woman,</hi> this adulterous Spouſe of J. Chriſt. And the H. Spirit could not have deſcribed her in a more lively manner, and more proper for us to know her.</p>
                        <p>This being ſuppoſed, that the <hi>Beaſt</hi> in the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth Chap. of the <hi>Revelations,</hi> is the ſame with that in the ſeventeenth, the later cannot be <hi>Rome Pagan,</hi> becauſe by the conſent even of all the <hi>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish Interpreters,</hi> the two <hi>Beaſts</hi> in the thirteenth Chap. repreſent the <hi>Empire</hi> of <hi>Antichriſt.</hi> On this confeſſion, and upon what we have juſt now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, we argue thus:</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Woman</hi> in the ſeventeenth Chapter, by the conſent of the <hi>popish Interpreters</hi> is <hi>Rome.</hi> And by the conſent of the ſame Interpreters, the <hi>Beaſt</hi> in the thirteenth Chap. is <hi>Antichriſt.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Now according to what we have juſt now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, the <hi>Beaſt</hi> of the ſeventeenth Chapter, and the thirteenth are one and the ſame <hi>Beaſt.</hi>
                        </p>

Whence it is clear, that <hi>Rome</hi> muſt be the ſeat of <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> and that <hi>Rome</hi> in the ſeventeenth Chapt. is not <hi>Rome Pagan.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>That <hi>Rome</hi> in the ſeventeenth Chapter is not <hi>Rome Pagan,</hi> appears not only by the compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Rome</hi> in the 17th. Chap. is not <hi>Rome Pagan.</hi>
                           </note> which we juſt before made of the two <hi>Beaſts,</hi> but alſo if we conſider the <hi>Beaſt</hi> of the 17<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chap. all alone, and without reference to that in the 13<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chapter.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">God never calls the Pagan So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties VVhores and Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſſes.</note>I. <hi>Firſt</hi> of all, there is a proſtitute, adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, and debauch'd <hi>Woman</hi> ſitting upon this <hi>Beaſt.</hi> Every one knows, that in the Holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures <hi>Adultery</hi> figuratively ſignifies <hi>Idolatry.</hi> Now we ſhall never find any one ſingle inſtance, where the Holy Spirit calls the <hi>Pagan Societies,</hi> Women and Spouſes, Whores and Adultereſſes. This name is given only to a corrupted Church. And the reaſon is plain, becauſe the <hi>Pagan Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> having never plighted their faith to God, have not broken it, and never were his Spouſe: they are not therefore unfaithful and adulterous in his account. So that this adulterous <hi>Woman</hi> cannot here be <hi>Rome Pagan,</hi> but that <hi>Rome</hi> that hath plighted her faith to <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and broken it; that <hi>Rome</hi> that ſtyles her ſelf <hi>the Spouſe of Jeſus,</hi> and yet doth proſtitute her ſelf to others.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, This <hi>Women</hi> is repreſented to us, as <hi>having in her hand a Cup of abominations of her whoredoms, of which she makes all the World to drink, i. e.</hi> ſhe endeavours to draw all the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Earth to her <hi>Idolatry.</hi> Now <hi>Rome Pagan</hi> never troubled her head to change the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> of thoſe people ſhe had conquer'd, nor to force them to worſhip the ſame <hi>Gods</hi> as ſhe did. On the contrary, every one knows, ſhe
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:95320:109" rendition="simple:additions"/>carried ſtrange <hi>Gods</hi> in Triumph, and built <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi> for them within her own walls.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Theſe words, <hi>the Beaſt which thou ſaweſt, was, and is not, and muſt aſcend out of the bottomleſs pit,</hi> or <hi>the deep,</hi> can by no means agree to <hi>Rome Pagan.</hi> For this plainly ſignifies, that the <hi>Empire</hi> ſpoken of muſt periſh, and be ſwallowed up, and afterwards be re-eſtabliſhed. Now <hi>Rome Pagan</hi> and its <hi>Empire</hi> have been ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up, but as <hi>Rome Pagan</hi> it is not raiſed up again. Beſides, we may obſerve by the by, that we do not deny, but that <hi>Rome Pagan</hi> is repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by this Beaſt; for the Beaſt repreſents the <hi>Roman Empire</hi> in its whole duration, and in both its <hi>periods,</hi> the <hi>Pagan</hi> period and the <hi>Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian</hi> period. <hi>The Beaſt which thou ſaweſt, was, and is not;</hi> there is the Pagan Period: and <hi>muſt aſcend out of the bottomleſs pit,</hi> or <hi>the deep;</hi> there is the <hi>Antichriſtian</hi> period.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Fourthly,</hi> It is ſaid of this Beaſt, <hi>And the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of the earth, whoſe names are not written in the book of Life, shall wonder, ſeeing the beaſt which was, and is not, and yet is.</hi> This ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies, that men ſhall give him homage, and that this homage ſhall be given to him only by the enemies of Jeſus Chriſt, and the Reprobates. It is not therefore <hi>Rome Pagan;</hi> for the true <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians</hi> obeyed, and gave a voluntary homage to the <hi>Roman Empire</hi> in its <hi>Pagan period,</hi> juſt as the other ſubjects of the <hi>Empire.</hi> But ſince it was raiſed up again, <hi>and is no longer what it once was,</hi> they have no longer obeyed it.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Fifthly,</hi> That which is ſaid of the ten <hi>Kings,</hi> can by no means agree to <hi>Rome</hi> in its <hi>Pagan</hi> Period. <hi>The ten Horns which thou ſaweſt, are ten Kings, which have not yet begun to reign, but shall receive

                        <p>Sixthly,<note place="margin">v. 13.</note> How can theſe words agree to <hi>Rome Pagan, theſe,</hi> i. e. theſe ten <hi>Kings have one mind, and shall give their power and ſtrength to the beaſt.</hi> Did thoſe <hi>Kings,</hi> whoſe Kingdoms were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd by the <hi>Roman Pagan Empire,</hi> voluntarily give their power to the <hi>Beaſt?</hi> Did not <hi>Rome Pagan</hi> by meer violence raviſh away thoſe great Eſtates, of which ſhe formed her <hi>Empire?</hi> Can it be ſaid, that the <hi>Kings</hi> that were conquer'd and ſubdued, had one mind?

For it is true, that the ten <hi>Kings</hi> compoſe this <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Empire,</hi> and ſubmit themſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it. It is true, that they have one mind, and that they have given their power unto the <hi>Beaſt.</hi> For it was not by Force of Arms, that <hi>Rome</hi> hath acquired this ſecond <hi>Empire;</hi> but by perſwaſion, by illuſion, by the falſe religion, by the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of idolatry, and by the <hi>Chimaera</hi> of an Empire of Jeſus Chriſt on the Earth.</p>

This is the only thing to be met with which the <hi>popish Interpreters</hi> have to oppoſe, to prove that <hi>Antichriſt</hi> muſt not ſit at <hi>Rome,</hi> and that <hi>Rome</hi> in this Chap. is <hi>Rome Pagan:</hi> ſay they, the <hi>ten Kings shall hate the Whore,</hi>

                        <p>
                           <hi>Laſtly,</hi> it is clear by the following Chapter, which is the 18<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, that <hi>the great City which reigneth over the kings of the earth,</hi> cannot be <hi>Rome Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan,</hi> but <hi>Rome Antichriſtian.</hi> In the 18<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chap. he calls her <hi>Babylon,</hi> whom juſt before he called the <hi>great city;</hi> and even the <hi>popish Interpreters</hi> agree alſo, that that <hi>Babylon</hi> is <hi>Rome.</hi> Now he deſcribes the fall of that <hi>Babylon,</hi> i. e. of <hi>Rome,</hi> in ſuch a manner as cannot agree to any other but <hi>Rome Antichriſtian. Firſt,</hi> He ſaith,<note place="margin">v. 3.</note> that <hi>all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions have drank of the wine of the wrath of her for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication.</hi> We have already ſeen, that this ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies that <hi>Idolatry,</hi> to which <hi>Babylon</hi> hath drawn the <hi>Nations</hi> by her Charms and Enchantments, which doth not agree to <hi>Rome Pagan.

                           <note place="margin">v. 4.</note> He ſaith, <hi>come out of Babylon my people, that ye be not partakers of her ſins, and that ye receive not of her plagues.</hi> 'Tis plain, this cannot be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of any thing but of an <hi>Idolatrous Church,</hi> whence God would draw forth his Elect.

And to conclude, he ſignifies, that it muſt be ſuch a fall, from which ſhe ſhall never riſe again. <hi>And a mighty Angel took up a ſtone like a great Mill-ſtone, and caſt it into the ſea, ſaying, Thus with violence shall that great City Babylon be thrown down,</hi>

                           <hi>Antichriſtian Empire</hi> at <hi>Rome:</hi> what need have we of another <hi>Antichriſt</hi> ſitting at <hi>Jeruſalem?</hi> Moreover, this <hi>Chimaera</hi> is founded on this prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, that the <hi>Beaſt</hi> in the 13<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chapt. which according to them repreſents <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> is not the ſame with the <hi>Beaſt</hi> in the 17<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chap. with the great <hi>City</hi> that ruleth over the <hi>Kings</hi> of the Earth, and with <hi>Babylon</hi> ſpoken of in the 14<hi rend="sup">th</hi> and the 18<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chapt.

                        <p>This <hi>Chimaera</hi> is ſo ill to be defended, that the more modern <hi>Papiſts</hi> have abandon'd it, and at laſt have been forced to acknowledge, that <hi>Rome</hi> muſt be the ſeat of <hi>Antichriſt;</hi> that the great <hi>City</hi> ſpoken of in the 11<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chapter, where Jeſus Chriſt was crucified, is not <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> but ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual <hi>Babylon,</hi> ſpoken of afterwards: and <hi>Bernard de Montreuil,</hi> that hath write ſince the reſt, though he retains that ancient dream, that <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt</hi> muſt come out of <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> yet he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes however, that the <hi>Babylonish Empire</hi> and the <hi>Antichriſtian</hi> are not two <hi>Empires,</hi> that muſt ſucceed one another, and the one deſtroy the other, according to the ſuppoſition of thoſe we were juſt now ſpeaking of.

He calls <hi>Antichriſt</hi> the Prince of the <hi>Apocalyptical Babylon.</hi> And he confeſſeth, that this <hi>Babylon</hi> is <hi>Rome;</hi> therefore he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth, that <hi>Rome</hi> muſt be <hi>Antichriſtian,</hi> and the capital City of <hi>Antichriſt, Babylon,</hi> ſaith he,

                        <p>It is true, ſay they, that <hi>Rome</hi> muſt be poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> that he muſt eſtabliſh <hi>Idolatry</hi> there, that <hi>Rome</hi> muſt become worſe than <hi>Rome Pagan</hi> was in the time of <hi>St. John,</hi> and than Eaſtern <hi>Babylon</hi> in the time of the <hi>Prophets;</hi> but this muſt laſt but three <hi>years</hi> and a <hi>half.</hi> When therefore we have deſtroyed this ridiculous dream of three natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>years</hi> and a <hi>half,</hi> we ſhall have demonſtrated, that <hi>Rome</hi> at this day is the true Seat of <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> and then I ſhall make them this Argument.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Babylon</hi> in the <hi>Revelation</hi> is the ſeat of the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſtian Empire,</hi> the ſame thing with the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute <hi>Woman,</hi> with the <hi>Beaſt</hi> with ſeven <hi>heads</hi> and ten <hi>horns.</hi> All this is <hi>Rome</hi> become <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian,</hi> and the ſeat of <hi>Antichriſt.</hi> Which is plain, either by what hath been invincibly proved, or what the <hi>Papiſts</hi> themſelves have confeſſed. Now this <hi>Antichriſtian Roman Empire</hi> muſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure, not 1260. natural <hi>days,</hi> but 1260. propheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal <hi>days,</hi> i. e. 1260. <hi>years.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Therefore it is evident, that the <hi>Antichriſtian Empire,</hi> which muſt be at <hi>Rome,</hi> cannot be that <hi>chimerical Empire of Antichriſt</hi> of three years and
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:95320:113"/>a half, that muſt conclude 45. <hi>days</hi> before the end of the World; and that 'tis that of <hi>Rome,</hi> which hath endured ſo long already. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence is plain, becauſe all do acknowledge, the World muſt not, and cannot according to the decrees of God, endure yet twelve or thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen hundred <hi>years,</hi> to make room for the reign of <hi>Antichriſt;</hi> and a thouſand <hi>years</hi> more at the end of that, to make room for the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> the truth and certainty of which we ſhall prove. So that if the reign of <hi>Antichriſt</hi> muſt endure 1260. <hi>years,</hi> it is neceſſary that it ſubſiſt at this preſent time, and that it hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun a long time ſince. This is, I ſay, a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration, which I have in readineſs for theſe Gentlemen, when I ſhall have proved the only thing in this argument, that can be called in queſtion, <hi>viz.</hi> that the 1260. <hi>days</hi> of <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt</hi> cannot be underſtood of ſo many natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>days.</hi> I would prove this truth preſently, were it not that it regards the time of the duration of the <hi>Antichriſtian Empire,</hi> of which we ſhall have occaſion afterwards to ſpeak. Wherefore now we ſhall continue to give you the explication of the <hi>Prophecies,</hi> that contain the <hi>Character</hi> of this <hi>Antichriſtian Empire.</hi>

                           </note>'Tis certain, this is one of the cleareſt Oracles of the New Teſtament, and one of the moſt live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pictures the Holy Spirit gives us of the <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian Apoſtacy.</hi> But I could not make uſe of it, in drawing my <hi>prejudices</hi> againſt the <hi>Roman Church;</hi> becauſe <hi>prejudices</hi> muſt be drawn from things either exceeding notorious, or confeſſed and granted. My <hi>prejudice</hi> was not this: No Religion that hath <hi>Antichriſt</hi> for its head, can be the true Religion. Now the <hi>Roman Religion</hi> hath <hi>Antichriſt</hi> for its head, &amp;c. If I had formed it thus, I had been obliged to bring all the proofs that are to be met with in the H. Scripture, to
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:95320:114"/>maintain, that the <hi>Roman Religion</hi> is the <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian Empire;</hi> and then I muſt not have omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted this. But I argued otherwiſe in that <hi>preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice;</hi> and ſaid, I judge not, but I <hi>prejudge.</hi> I do not pronounce, that <hi>the Pope and his religion are Antichriſt.</hi> But I ſay, it is very ſtrange and ſurprizing, that all thoſe places of Scripture, where, by the conſent of Interpreters of all ages and of all parties, <hi>Antichriſt</hi> is ſpoken of, may be ſo eaſily and ſo juſtly applied to the <hi>Pope</hi> and his <hi>religion.</hi> Though at the bottom <hi>popery</hi> ſhould not be pure <hi>Antichriſtianiſm,</hi> yet there is no like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyhood, that God would deſcribe <hi>Antichriſt</hi> and his reign in ſuch equivocal terms, that all that that is confeſſed to be ſpoken concerning <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt,</hi> may be adopted to him that ſhould be the <hi>Vicar</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt, and to a <hi>Society</hi> that ſhould be his faithful Spouſe. 'Tis plain, that to reaſon thus, I was to look for no other Texts, but thoſe that are not conteſted; ſuch as are the ſecond Chapt. of the ſecond Epiſtle to the <hi>Theſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalonians,</hi> the ſeventh of <hi>Daniel,</hi> the 11, 13, 17, and 18<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> whereas the <hi>Romish Doctors</hi> do diſpute about all, in the words of <hi>St. Paul</hi> in the fourth Chapter of his firſt Epiſtle to <hi>Timothy.</hi> They diſpute about the particular ſenſe and the general ſcope of it. They turn this Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle off on the <hi>Encratites, Manichees,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>Now, that I am not a drawing <hi>prejudices,</hi> but do diſpute, I muſt prove; and though the proofs are conteſted, yet we muſt not abandon them in a controverſy. We muſt only make them ſo evident, that they may be clear to all reaſonable men. And this is that, which we are about to do in purſuing the Hiſtory of the <hi>Characters</hi> of the <hi>Antichriſtian Apoſtacy,</hi> by this paſſage of St. <hi>Paul,</hi>
                           <pb n="179" facs="tcp:95320:114"/>according to that ſenſe of it, which the learned <hi>Joſeph Mede</hi> gives us; who hath given us abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of light into the <hi>Prophecies,</hi> but into none of them more, or more happily than into this.</p>

But the Spirit ſaith expreſly, that in the later times ſome ſhall depart from the faith, giving heed to ſeducing Spirits and Doctrines of Devills.</hi> This obſervation alone is enough to perſwade all thoſe that ſincerely ſeek after the truth, that the <hi>Apoſtacy,</hi> which the Apoſtle ſpeaks of, is the <hi>Apoſtacy of Antichriſt.</hi> For he makes ſo clear an oppoſition of this apoſtacy to the <hi>Myſtery of Godlineſs,</hi> that 'tis impoſſible not to diſcern, that he oppoſes <hi>Myſtery</hi> to myſtery, religion to religion; the <hi>myſtery of Godlineſs</hi> to the <hi>myſtery of iniquity,</hi> of which he himſelf hath ſpoken to us in his 2d.

<pb n="180" facs="tcp:95320:115"/>Empire</hi> and <hi>Religion.</hi> And that the reaſon why the Apoſtle hath not here repeated the term of the <hi>myſtery of iniquity,</hi> is becauſe he did believe, that it would be eaſily underſtood.

                        </p>
                        <p>'Tis exactly the very ſame word, which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> uſes in the ſecond Chap. of the ſecond Epiſtle to the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> where by the confeſſion of all, he deſcribes the coming of the <hi>Antichriſtian Empire.

                           <note place="margin">The Idea which the word Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacy rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth in the mind.</note> This term of <hi>apoſtacy</hi> at this day begets a dreadful Idea in mens minds.

'Tis this, that the term of <hi>apoſtacy,</hi> which ſignifies the <hi>Empire</hi> of <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhews, that the <hi>Antichriſt</hi> of the <hi>Romish Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors,</hi> is a meer <hi>Chimaera.</hi> According to them, he muſt be a <hi>Jew</hi> that muſt ſtyle himſelf the <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah,</hi> aſſemble all the <hi>Jews</hi> at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> make war on the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and deſtroy <hi>Chriſtianity.</hi> If he be a <hi>Jew</hi> by nation and religion, he will not be an <hi>Apoſtate.</hi> For according to the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture uſage of the word, and that of the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages at this day, none are called <hi>Apoſtates,</hi> but thoſe that abandon the true <hi>religion</hi> to embrace a falſe one. So that ſee here is a new proof, that <hi>Antichriſtianiſm</hi> muſt eſtabliſh it ſelf in <hi>Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> and the <hi>Subjects</hi> and <hi>Prince</hi> of this <hi>Empire,</hi> muſt be <hi>Apoſtates</hi> from the <hi>Chriſtian religion,</hi> which cannot agree to the <hi>Jews.</hi> We muſt not ſay, that this <hi>Empire of Antichriſt</hi> is called an <hi>apoſtacy,</hi> becauſe it will cauſe the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> to revolt, and make them <hi>Apoſtates:</hi> For it is plain, that the <hi>head</hi> of this <hi>Empire</hi> muſt himſelf be an <hi>Apoſtate. That day shall not come, except there be firſt a falling away, or an apoſtacy, and the man of ſin the ſon of perdition be revealed.</hi> One may plainly ſee, that this ſignifies, before the <hi>apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacy</hi> of the man of ſin happens.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">The revolt of the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſm</hi> from the faith is very well called an <hi>Apoſtacy.</hi>
                           </note>At the preſent to make appear, that the revolt of the <hi>Papiſm</hi> from the faith is very juſtly ſtyled an <hi>apoſtacy,</hi> divers things muſt be obſerv'd. And <hi>firſt,</hi> That this word in its original, doth not ſignify all that, that men at this day would ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy by it.

                           <pb n="185" facs="tcp:95320:117"/>
So <hi>Apoſtacy</hi> originally ſignifies a <hi>departure;</hi> 'tis to depart from the obedience which is due to any one. 'Tis to refuſe him, either the whole, or a part of that homage, that is due to him. 'Tis not without a great myſtery of Providence, that ſuch extravagant Ideas, and ſuch as are not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the intention of the H. Spirit, ſhould be affixed to the names deſigned to ſignify the <hi>Antichriſtian Empire</hi> and its <hi>head.</hi> For example, <hi>the man of ſin, the ſon of perdition, the Beaſt with ſeven heads full of blaſphemies, the great Whore, the Cup of abomination, Antichriſt.</hi> Exceſſive Ideas, I ſay have been affixed to theſe names, as if hereby it were ſignified, that the <hi>perſon</hi> and the <hi>Empire,</hi> deſigned by theſe names, ſhould have nothing of the Chriſtian; yea, nothing of humane in it, and that they ſhould be prodigies of impiety, madneſs, blaſphemy and impurity. The ſame thing hath happen'd in the term <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacy,</hi> to which hath been affixed the Idea of an utter renunciation of the faith. And this hath not come to paſs without a ſingular Providence of God, who would not have <hi>Antichriſt</hi> to be known, to the end that during his birth and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment no man might oppoſe him.</p>
                        <p>Our ſecond Obſervation is, that the word <hi>apoſtacy</hi> in the Scripture uſe of it, anſwers to the Hebrew word <hi>mered</hi> rebellion,<note place="margin">The word Apoſtacy properly ſignifies rebellion.</note> and <hi>marad</hi> to rebel. 'Tis very uſual with the 70. Interpreters, to render theſe <hi>Hebrew</hi> words by thoſe of, to <hi>apoſtatize</hi> and <hi>apoſtacy,</hi> whether it be <hi>rebellion</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God, or <hi>rebellion</hi> againſt men that is treated of. The <hi>Reubenites</hi> and <hi>Gadites,</hi> returning home, after they had aſſiſted their Brethren, to ſettle themſelves on the other ſide of <hi>Jordan,</hi> built an Altar on the bank of the river. The other <hi>Tribes</hi>
                           <pb n="186" facs="tcp:95320:118"/>imagining, that the <hi>Reubenites</hi> &amp; <hi>Gadites</hi> intended to ſacrifice on that Altar againſt the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, they ſay to them, <hi>ye rebel againſt the Lord.</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Joſh. 22.18, 19.</note> 
                           <hi>Timeredou,</hi> which in the Greek is rendred, <hi>you are become Apoſtates from the Lord.</hi> On the other hand, the <hi>Reubenites</hi> juſtifying themſelves, ſay, <hi>the Lord knows, if this thing be done in rebellion.</hi> They uſe this word <hi>mered,</hi> and the <hi>ſeptuagint</hi> have rendred it by that of <hi>apoſtacy.</hi> When the Spies returned, <hi>Joshuah</hi> and <hi>Caleb</hi> being deſirous to induce the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue their journey, to endeavour the conqueſt of the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> according to the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God, they ſay to them, <hi>revolt not, al timeredou;</hi> and the <hi>Greek</hi> hath it, <hi>do not turn apoſtates.</hi> Inſtances are without number, and 'tis ſufficient to have intimated it.</p>
                        <p>According to this uſe of the word, which is certainly the Scripture uſe of it, 'tis evident that the <hi>Papiſm</hi> is a true <hi>apoſtacy,</hi> a <hi>rebellion,</hi> a <hi>revolt.</hi> To be an <hi>Apoſtate</hi> in the Scripture ſenſe,<note place="margin">Apoſtacy doth not always ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify a total defection.</note> it is not neceſſary that a man ſhould utterly abandon the true God. When the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> on this ſide <hi>Jor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan,</hi> accuſe the <hi>Reubenites</hi> of an intention to turn <hi>Apoſtates, do not revolt,</hi> they do not ſo much as ſuſpect, that they intend entirely to renounce God, but only to build an altar againſt the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar of <hi>Moſes,</hi> to ſacrifice to that <hi>God</hi> that brought them out of <hi>Egypt. Do not apoſtatize,</hi> ſay they to them, <hi>in building you an Altar beſides the Altar of the Lord our God.</hi> When <hi>Caleb</hi> and <hi>Joshuah</hi> ſay to the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> on the occaſion of their refuſing to go towards the Land of <hi>Canaan, do not apoſtatize,</hi> they did not apprehend, that the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were minded to chuſe another God; but only that they would revolt from the orders
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:95320:118"/>of the true God, but yet without renouncing him for their God.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">How the Papiſm de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroys the Articles of faith.</note>It is not therefore neceſſary, that the <hi>Papiſm</hi> ſhould be a formal and entire <hi>renunciation</hi> of the <hi>faith;</hi> it is enough that 'tis a <hi>revolting</hi> from the faith. Now certainly the <hi>Papiſm</hi> is ſo. There are none of the <hi>Articles</hi> of the <hi>Chriſtian faith,</hi> which it doth not deſtroy, and againſt which it doth not plant its engines. There are rebels, that do in words acknowledge a Prince for their King, who yet do not ceaſe to make war againſt him. This is the ordinary way of rebels. The <hi>Papiſm</hi> doth perfectly the very ſame thing. It doth homage in words to the principal <hi>Articles</hi> of the <hi>Chriſtian faith,</hi> but indeed it fights againſt them, it deſtroys them. It acknowledges a <hi>God manifeſt in the flesh;</hi> but it <hi>revolts</hi> from this <hi>Article,</hi> and deſtroys it by another carnal God, or a God in the fleſh, i. e. <hi>the Bishop of Rome,</hi> to whom it aſcribes a double power, which agrees to Jeſus Chriſt alone, and which even Jeſus Chriſt himſelf would not exerciſe, while he was here upon Earth. It deſtroys alſo this <hi>God manifeſt in the flesh</hi> by another Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>incarnated, breaden, tranſubſtantiated,</hi> indiviſibly united to the accidents of the bread; and of this falſe Chriſt it makes a true <hi>Idol.</hi> It believes <hi>one Jeſus, the redeemer of the World;</hi> but it deſtroys this <hi>article</hi> of faith, and <hi>revolts</hi> from it, in ſaying, the <hi>Saints</hi> are our mediators, in offering to God their <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,</hi> beſides the merits of Jeſus Chriſt, and in praying to God in their name and by their inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion. <hi>It believes one only God;</hi> but it <hi>revolts</hi> from this <hi>article,</hi> in ſuppoſing new objects of worſhip, to which it renders a truly religious worſhip. It believes that <hi>the blood of J. Chriſt
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:95320:119"/>cleanſeth us from all ſin;</hi> but it <hi>revolts</hi> from this <hi>Article</hi> divers ways, in ſeeking out ſtrange ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactions, and in ſuppoſing a <hi>purgatory,</hi> the uſe of which is to expiate the ſins of men.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">'Tis an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtacy from the faith to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce that Which is beſide the faith.</note>And that we may clearly underſtand, that all theſe things and others of the like nature, may very well be called an <hi>Apoſtacy</hi> from the <hi>faith,</hi> we muſt again make uſe of that paſſage in the 22<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chapt. of the book of <hi>Joshua,</hi> where the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> ſay to their brethren, <hi>do not apoſtatize in building an Altar, beſides the Altar of the Lord.</hi> Theſe words ſhew, that one may be an <hi>apoſtate,</hi> not only by bringing things into Religion, which are <hi>againſt</hi> Religion, but alſo in promoting things that are <hi>beſides</hi> Religion.

                           <note place="margin">'Tis an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate any creature before Gods face.</note>That this may be more plain with reſpect to the <hi>invocation of Saints,</hi> and to take off the veil, under which they hide the horrours of that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; we muſt obſerve, that that ſitting of Jeſus Chriſt at the right hand of his Father, imports a very near preſence of the Son, who aſſiſts per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually before his Father, and who is perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually before his face, environn'd and (as I may ſo ſay) buried by the rays of that glorious face of God. <hi>Thou shalt not have other Gods before my face.</hi> This face of God is a lively ſpring of light, that ſwallows up whatſoever there is of brightneſs in the moſt excellent creatures, in ſuch a manner, that they are as nothing in the preſence of God. There is but one <hi>creature,</hi> that is not ſwallowed up by theſe rays, and that is the <hi>humane nature</hi> of the Son of God. That is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held by the glory of the ſecond Perſon, to which it is ſupernaturally united. By reaſon of this, the Son may be invocated before the face, and in the preſence of the Father, becauſe the glory of the Son is not ſwallowed up and annihilated by the glory of the Father. But it is a true abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:95320:122"/>to go and worſhip, and invocate a ſimple creature before the face of God, and at the foot of his Throne.</p>
                        <p>This conſideration doth utterly deſtroy that vain pretence, which ſo many take for a good reaſon.<note place="margin">One may pray the Saints which are on Earth, to pray to God for us; becauſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing far from the face of God, they are not ſwallowed up by his beams.</note> We lawfully pray the <hi>Saints</hi> on Earth to pray to God for us, ſay they; what greater harm is there to invocate them in the heavens? The difference is plain; the <hi>Saints</hi> that are upon Earth, are conceived as far from God, their rays are not ſwallowed up by the infinite brightneſs of the Divinity, we may give them ſome homage. But to go and ſerve them before the face of God; to give them a religious worſhip in Heaven, 'tis inſolently to violate the Majeſty of God. And under what pretence ſoever it may be done, 'tis a bold attempt, that is not pardonable. A <hi>Subject</hi> that is highly preferred, when he is alone, and far from his <hi>Prince,</hi> may receive great honours from thoſe that are beneath him. But both the ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt and the greateſt, when they are in the <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign's</hi> preſence, are equal. It would be a piece of <hi>high Treaſon,</hi> to render homage to a <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject</hi> before the <hi>Soveraign's</hi> face. The Sun ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows up all the Stars. The glory of God in his Throne annihilates all glory. 'Tis therefore an odious crime, to go and render homage to the <hi>Saints</hi> at the foot of the Throne of God. If I honour the <hi>Saints</hi> here below by my praiſes and my imitation of them, this doth not reach to the Throne of God, 'tis to men that I ſpeak; but my prayers reach Heaven. There is but one <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject</hi> that doth invocate in the behalf of others in the Heavens, and but one <hi>Object</hi> that may be invocated. This is what <hi>St. Paul</hi> means, <hi>There is but one God, and one Mediator between God
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:95320:122"/>and men.</hi> There is but one <hi>God,</hi> that may be prayed to in the Heavens, and only one <hi>Jeſus</hi> that prayeth for men. So that I conclude, that the <hi>invocation of the Saints</hi> is an <hi>abomination</hi> and an <hi>apoſtacy, becauſe it highly affronts Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> in that double manner as we have ſaid, both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it ſnatches away from him the priviledge of aſſiſting alone at the right hand of the Father, and becauſe it violates the Majeſty of God, in whoſe preſence all grandeur diſappears. So far are the <hi>Saints</hi> from being more worthy of ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration becauſe of their glorification, that on the contrary, the more they are glorified, and the nearer they are to God, the more are they as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing and inviſible. Add to this, that <hi>J. Chriſt</hi> hath reſerv'd it to himſelf as an incommunicable piece of his glory, that we ſhould call on the Father in his name. The <hi>Papiſm</hi> calls on him in the name of <hi>Saints;</hi> for it invocates him by the merit and interceſſion of the <hi>Saints.</hi> This is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other <hi>abomination.</hi> As to the adoration of <hi>Images,</hi> 'tis ſo plain an <hi>abomination</hi> and <hi>apoſtacy,</hi> that it cannot at this day any longer be defended, but by denying it, and ſaying, God forbid that we ſhould adore or ſerve <hi>Images,</hi> we only make uſe of them, as a means to aſcend to their originals.</p>

                           <note place="margin">Yet it is deſcribed in higher terms.</note>It appears therefore, that the <hi>Idolatry</hi> of the <hi>Heathens,</hi> who worſhipped none but falſe Gods, was more criminal; however, the Holy Spirit ſpeaks againſt the <hi>Idolatry</hi> of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> with a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times more violence and vehemence than a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt that of the <hi>Heathens.</hi> The Prophets de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe the <hi>heathen Idolaters</hi> as fools, as brutiſh perſons, that had loſt their ſenſes, who of the ſame <hi>log of wood</hi> made a <hi>God</hi> and a <hi>foot-ſtool.</hi> But when they ſpeak of the <hi>Idolatry</hi> of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> they do it in ſuch terms as make perſons of any modeſty to bluſh. For there are no odious Ideas in the moſt infamous proſtitution, which the H. Spirit doth not bring in in his deſcription of them.

                        <p>The reaſon of this difference is plain, 'tis be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the <hi>Idolatry</hi> of the <hi>Heathens</hi> is conſider'd
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:95320:123"/>only as a ſimple <hi>fornication,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">The Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry of the Church is moſt cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal, and why.</note> and the <hi>Idolatry</hi> of <hi>Iſrael</hi> as <hi>adultery.</hi> Every one knows the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between ſimple Fornication and Adultery. Almoſt all nations have puniſh'd <hi>adultery</hi> with death. But the <hi>Heathens</hi> did ſcarce think that <hi>fornication</hi> was a ſin; the <hi>Jews</hi> themſelves coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it as a trivial matter. A man ſees the worſt of crimes committed upon a <hi>woman</hi> that belongs not to him, without being much moved at it; but the leaſt debauches of his own <hi>wife</hi> ſtir up his jealouſie, and kindle his anger. He can't ſpeak of them without vehemence, and in terms that ſignify the greatneſs of his grief. And 'tis not an unreaſonable reſentment. A <hi>woman</hi> with whom he hath made no treaty, that hath not plighted her troth to him, nor he his to her, doth him no wrong, there is no ſhame redounds to him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by; whereas the crimes of his <hi>wife</hi> cover him with infamy. 'Tis the ſame with God; the <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry</hi> of the <hi>Heathens</hi> in his opinion is but a ſimple <hi>fornication,</hi> he hath made no treaty with them who are without the <hi>covenant;</hi> no ſhame, nor diſhonour is reflected on him from their debau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheries. But he hath treated with the <hi>Church,</hi> ſhe is his <hi>Spouſe;</hi> he calls her ſo; 'tis a figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive expreſſion that he every where uſes. We need not therefore wonder, if he be more ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of thoſe wrongs, that are done him on her part. Although the <hi>Idolatries</hi> of the <hi>Heathens</hi> were greater, conſidering them preciſely in themſelves, than the <hi>Idolatries</hi> of the <hi>Church;</hi> yet however, God would not be ſo much offended by them. A <hi>Husband</hi> is more offended by the light debaucheries of his <hi>Spouſe,</hi> than by the greateſt crimes of one that is only his <hi>Kinſwoman.</hi> It ſignifies nothing, that this <hi>woman</hi> doth not
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:95320:124"/>deny her Husband her favours; if ſhe ſuffer others to ſhare with him, her crime is not the leſs. It ſignifies nothing alſo, that the <hi>Church</hi> doth not refuſe to give adoration to the true <hi>God;</hi> if ſhe ſuffer the creatures to be ſharers with him, ſhe is not leſs criminal; ſhe is ſtill an <hi>Adultereſs,</hi> and her crime is an <hi>abomination.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>It is eaſy to apply all this to the <hi>Chriſtian Church;</hi> the bands of the <hi>ſacred marriage</hi> that unite her to her <hi>God</hi> are much more noble, glorious and ſtrait than thoſe that united God to the Synagogue. So her <hi>adulteries</hi> alſo are much more worthy to be condemned. It ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies nothing, that ſhe commits them with thoſe that are called the friends of God. A <hi>King</hi> is not the leſs offended by the diſorders of his <hi>Spouſe,</hi> that proſtitutes her ſelf to his <hi>favourites,</hi> than if ſhe proſtituted her ſelf to <hi>ſtrangers.</hi> And thus, I think, enough hath been ſaid to juſtify this, <hi>that the Papiſm is a true Apoſtacy,</hi> and that that term, and others, though higher, are not too big to ſignify the <hi>abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> of the <hi>Antichriſtian Empire.</hi>

But beſides, that this uſurpation is joined with <hi>Idolatry,</hi> ſeeing they make an <hi>Idol</hi> of the <hi>Pope,</hi> I ſay, there is in <hi>Antichriſtianiſm</hi> an <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire</hi> and a <hi>Religion.</hi> The Empire is <hi>Diabolical, Tyrannical, Antichriſtian,</hi> and may well be called and Empire of <hi>Devils,</hi> as having them for its Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors. And 'tis in this reſpect of an Empire and a Tyranny, that <hi>St. Paul</hi> principally conſiders <hi>Antichriſtianiſm</hi> in the ſecond Chapter of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Epiſtle to the <hi>Theſſalonians.</hi> For there he repreſents the <hi>head</hi> of this <hi>Empire,</hi> as a Tyrant that ſits himſelf down on the Throne of God, and was to poſſeſs the <hi>Empire,</hi> when he that then held it, was caſt down.

<pb n="205" facs="tcp:95320:127"/>ſiders it alſo a little as a <hi>Religion;</hi> for he calls it a <hi>Myſtery,</hi> and ſaith, it ſhall be eſtabliſht by falſe <hi>ſigns</hi> and falſe <hi>miracles.</hi> But in this fourth Chap. of the firſt Epiſtle to <hi>Timothy,</hi> he conſiders <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſtianiſm</hi> purely as a <hi>Religion,</hi> and not as an <hi>Empire.</hi> Therefore he ſpeaks only of <hi>Apoſtacy, Spirits, Deceivers, and of Doctrines.</hi> Now, that which is moſt abominable in the <hi>Papiſm,</hi> as 'tis a <hi>Religion,</hi> is without doubt its <hi>Idolatry,</hi> and not its <hi>hereſies;</hi> and conſequently, this is what we muſt here underſtand by the <hi>Doctrine of Devils,</hi> or of <hi>Daemons.</hi> For the Apoſtle intends by that to note that which is moſt criminal in the <hi>Papiſm.</hi> Seeing therefore we muſt neceſſarily underſtand by theſe words <hi>Doctrine of Daemons,</hi> the <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian Idolatry,</hi> why ſhould we not believe, that the Apoſtle <hi>Saint Paul</hi> calls it ſo by way of allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and comparing it with the <hi>heathen Religion</hi> and <hi>Theology?</hi>

For the entire Nation of the <hi>Jews</hi> is engaged in this revolt. There was but a ſmall number of the <hi>Jews</hi> that believed on Jeſus Chriſt, and believed truely. And certainly, the proportion that is between the ſmall company of the faithful, that love not the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> and thoſe that adore him, is greater than that which was between the converted <hi>Jews,</hi> and thoſe that have remained unbelievers theſe 16 hundred <hi>years.</hi> The ſame Apoſtle ſpeaking of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, that worſhipped the <hi>golden Calf,</hi>

The Apoſtle might the rather uſe this like expreſſion, becauſe the <hi>Antichriſtian idolatry</hi> and <hi>Apoſtacy</hi> were ſhadowed forth by theſe revolts of the people of the <hi>Jews</hi> in the Wilderneſs.</p>
                        <p>To this we may add, that the Apoſtle <hi>St. Paul</hi> conſiders this evil not in its laſt <hi>period,</hi> but in its beginning.

The ſin of <hi>Eſau,</hi> that deſpiſed the right of primo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geniture, and ſold it for a meſs of broth, was a <hi>type</hi> of thoſe prophane ones, that renounce the benefits of the World to come, for the vanities of this preſent World. <hi>Lots wife,</hi> that looked to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Sodom,</hi> and the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> that turn'd their eyes towards <hi>Egypt,</hi> after they were gone forth from it, are <hi>types</hi> of thoſe miſerable perſons, who after they have been drawn from ſin by the grace of Jeſus Chriſt, are eager after the World from which they were departed, and return to it again.</p>
                        <p>As therefore <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> hath had his <hi>types,</hi>

                        </p>
                        <p>But we muſt obſerve, there are two ſort of <hi>Prophecies;</hi> one that directly reſpect the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal ſubject, the other that reſpect it only mediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and indirectly, and by the means of ſome <hi>type,</hi> to which the literal ſenſe of the <hi>Proph<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="235" facs="tcp:95320:142"/>the intervention of any <hi>type.</hi>
                           <note place="margin">There are Prophecies wherein the things agree part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the <hi>type,</hi> partly to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the <hi>type.</hi>
                           </note> But the 45<hi rend="sup">th</hi>

                           <hi>Pſal.</hi> the <hi>type</hi> is <hi>Solomon,</hi> and 'tis him the literal ſenſe of the Text reſpects. Theſe two ſorts of <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies</hi> ought to be handled differently. Thoſe of the firſt rank, <hi>i. e.</hi> thoſe that refer only and immediately to <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> muſt be applied only and uniformly to Jeſus Chriſt in all their parts. But thoſe of the ſecond rank are much harder to be diſintricated. For there are ſome things that belong only to the perſon that is the <hi>type.</hi> Others that belong only to the perſon that is repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the <hi>type;</hi> and laſtly, others that belong both to the one and the other. For example, in the 45<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                           <hi>Pſal.</hi> theſe words, <hi>Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever; the ſcepter of thy Kingdom is a ſcep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Righteouſneſs,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>O God, thy God hath an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ointed thee with the oil of gladneſs above all thy fellows.</hi> Theſe words, I ſay, cannot without great violence be applied to <hi>Solomon.</hi> For <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> is not a God, and it can't be to him that the H. Spirit ſaith, <hi>Thy throne, O God,</hi> &amp;c. There are other words in the ſame <hi>Pſalm,</hi> which cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly reſpect <hi>Solomon</hi> as a <hi>type,</hi> and <hi>J. Chriſt</hi> as the perſon repreſented by the <hi>type.</hi> For example, <hi>Thou art fairer than any of the children of men:</hi>
                           <note place="margin">v. 3.</note> 
                           <hi>Grace is poured into thy lips, becauſe God hath bleſſed thee for ever.

                           <hi>Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Kings are among thy honourable women: upon thy right hand did ſtand the Queen in gold

I know well indeed, one may eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly imagine ſomething thereupon, but I do not believe that it would be ſolid. 'Tis the fault which they fall into, that do explain the <hi>types:</hi> they ſtretch the parallels, and fain would have the pictures in every thing reſemble the original. Whereas we muſt not ſearch after the reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance, but in the principal ſubject. All the reſt is but as the leaves that do adorn the picture.</p>
                        <p>'Tis according to theſe principles, that we muſt explain the <hi>Prophecies</hi> of the eighth, eleventh and twelfth of <hi>Daniel.</hi> As to the latter, 'tis the hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of <hi>Antiochus.</hi> This <hi>Antiochus</hi> having been the moſt conſiderable <hi>type</hi> of <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> as <hi>David</hi> was the moſt glorious <hi>type</hi> of <hi>Ieſus Chriſt;</hi> 'tis not to be doubted, but that there are in the <hi>Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi> that reſpect <hi>Antiochus,</hi> many things that muſt have a myſtical reference to <hi>Antichriſt.</hi> But 'tis not neceſſary, that all that is ſaid of <hi>Antiochus</hi> in the literal ſenſe, muſt be applied to <hi>Antichriſt</hi> in a myſtical ſenſe. In ſome places <hi>Antichriſt</hi> is there with <hi>Antiochus,</hi> in ſome other places <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiochus</hi> is there alone, and it may be there are ſome places where <hi>Antichriſt</hi> is alone. Let us briefly review them</p>

'Tis certain, this <hi>little Horns</hi> is <hi>Antiochus.</hi> He is deſcribed by a <hi>little Horn,</hi> becauſe he climbed the throne not by the lawful right of ſucceſſion, publickly and with full right; but by ſubtilty he raviſht the Kingdom from <hi>Demetrius</hi> the ſon of his brother <hi>Seleucus.</hi> Therefore the H.

                        <p>In the 11<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. Ch. the Prophet begins from the 21<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. verſe to ſpeak of <hi>Antiochus.</hi> But we muſt not look for <hi>Antichriſt</hi> therein till the 34. v. The ten firſt verſes are a deſcription of the victories, which <hi>Antiochus</hi> obtain'd over his neighbours; and of his quarrels with the <hi>Kings</hi> of <hi>Egypt,</hi> quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels which in my opinion had nothing <hi>Typical</hi> in them. And the reaſon of it is clear, becauſe <hi>Antiochus</hi> was not a <hi>Type</hi> but in what he did againſt the <hi>Church.</hi> For the ſtrange nations had no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to the <hi>Church;</hi> nothing that the Tyrants did againſt them is myſticall. At the 31. v. begin the violences which this perſecuting <hi>Prince</hi> was to offer to the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Iſrael. Arms ſhall ſtand on his part, and they ſhall pollute the ſanctuary of ſtrength, and ſhall take away the daily ſacrifice.</hi> This is what was already ſaid in the 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. Ch. and what we have applied to the <hi>Papiſm</hi> and its <hi>head.</hi> The Prophet adds,<note place="margin">v. 32.33.</note> 
                           <hi>And ſuch as do wickedly againſt the covenant ſhall he corrupt by flatterier; and they that underſtand among the people ſhall inſtruct many.</hi> He continues to the 36<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. v. to deſcribe the ways full of fraud and violence,<note place="margin">The <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſm</hi> was eſtabliſhed by fraud and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.</note> which the <hi>Tyrant</hi> was to make uſe of, to pervert the nation of the <hi>Jews,</hi> the conſtancy of ſome, the falling of many. And all this without doubt agrees to the <hi>head</hi> of the <hi>Papiſm,</hi> as well as to <hi>Antiochus;</hi> the application is eaſy, every one may make it. For all the world knows, how many frauds have been uſed by the <hi>Papiſm</hi> to engage the true believers in a revolt, and how always violence hath been uſed together with fraud. In the 36. v. the H.
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:95320:145"/>Spirit purſues the deſcription of the Tyrant, and ſaith, <hi>This King ſhall do according to his will, and ſhall exalt himſelf, and magnify himſelf above every God, and ſhall ſpeak marvellous things againſt the God of Gods, and ſhall proſper till the indignation be accompliſht; for that that is determin'd ſhall be done.</hi> This is ſo like what <hi>St. Paul</hi> ſaith, that <hi>the ſon of perdition ſhall exalt himſelf above all that is called God,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">The <hi>Pope</hi> exalts him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf above all that is called God.</note> 
                           <hi>and that he ſhall ſit in the Temple of God as if he were God;</hi> And to that which <hi>St. John</hi> ſaith of the Firſt <hi>Beaſt</hi> in the 13<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. Ch. that <hi>there was given to him a mouth ſpeaking great things, and blaſphemies, and that he open'd his mouth in blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy againſt God, to blaſpheme his name, and his Tabernacle, and them that dwell in Heaven.</hi> This, I ſay, is ſo like, that tis inpoſſible not to ſee that 'tis the ſame thing. This paſſage of <hi>Daniel</hi> gives us a great deal of light for the underſtanding that of the <hi>Revelation.</hi> When we would apply theſe words to the <hi>Papiſm</hi> and its head, <hi>he ſhall exalt himſelf above all that is called God, and ſpeak blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies againſt God,</hi> they cry out 'tis notorious to all the world that the <hi>Pope</hi> calls himſelf the moſt obedient <hi>ſervant</hi> of the true God, and doth not blaſpheme his name. Juſt the very ſame is ſaid of <hi>Antiochus, he ſhall magnify himſelf above every God; He ſhall not regard the God of his Fathers, and he ſhall not regard any God.</hi>

Never did any ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:95320:145"/>Prince carry this falſe zeal ſo far.

This ſo fierce a Prince was obliged to render homage to the <hi>Romans,</hi> to pay them tribute of gold, of ſilver, and precious ſtones.

It muſt be anſwer'd, that <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes</hi> muſt not here be diſtinguiſht from his <hi>father.</hi> Firſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was in his time that this ſervitude began, and he himſelf was given as an <hi>Hoſtage</hi> to the

                           <hi>Ramans</hi> for a pledge of the fidelity of his father. <hi>Secondly,</hi> He continued the ſame ſervitude, and payed Tribute. And his being <hi>Hoſtage</hi> at <hi>Rome</hi> many years, going to render Homage to this God even in his own ſeat, makes the ſervitude and the homage principally fall on him, and they may be juſtly attributed to him. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Though the ſervitude began in the time of his <hi>father,</hi> never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs the Prophecy particularly fixes it on the <hi>Son,</hi> becauſe of that pride which was peculiar to him.

                        <p>This is an accident that to me ſeems marvellous, that this <hi>prophecy</hi> found its accompliſhment in <hi>Rome</hi> and in the <hi>Romans,</hi> as well in the temporal as in the ſpiritual ſenſe. I ſaid above, that <hi>Antiochus</hi> was not a <hi>type</hi> of <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> but in the things he did a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Jewish Nation.</hi> Becauſe the ſtrange Nations having no reference to the <hi>Church,</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that Tyrants do againſt the Nations, is myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal. Therefore we must not ſeek after a myſtery in that, which the Prophecy fore-tells that <hi>Antiochus</hi> ſhould do againſt the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> against <hi>Ptolomee,</hi> and in reference to other people. But 'tis reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to except the <hi>Romans</hi> from this rule. Though they then were a nation estranged from the <hi>Church,</hi> yet however they had a reference to the <hi>Church.</hi> For <hi>Rome</hi> was to be the <hi>head</hi> of the <hi>Antichriſtian Church.</hi> And already in the Prophecies <hi>Rome Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan</hi> that then was, made but one <hi>beaſt, i. e.</hi> one <hi>Empire</hi> with <hi>Rome Chriſtian</hi> and <hi>Antichriſtian;</hi> so that it was proper to the genius of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy, that the <hi>type</hi> of the <hi>Roman Antichriſt</hi>
                           <pb n="252" facs="tcp:95320:151"/>ſhould be a <hi>type</hi> in what he did with reſpect to the <hi>Romans.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Beſides, it can't be thought ſtrange, that the ſame <hi>prophecy</hi> ſhould have two proſpects, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently two accompliſhments. For ſo it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in thoſe Prophecies, that turn on a <hi>typical</hi> ſubject. That which may make ſome difficulty, is, that the temporal adventures of the <hi>type</hi> have uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly their figurative reſpect to the ſpiritual adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of the thing repreſented by the <hi>type.</hi> Which doth not appear here: for the homages which <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiochus</hi> rendred to the <hi>Romans,</hi> do not appear to have any typical reference to the homages, which the <hi>new Romans</hi> give to their <hi>Demi-gods.</hi> They have however, and it is certain, that the homage which the <hi>new</hi> ſubjects of the <hi>Roman Empire</hi> do render at <hi>Rome</hi> to its <hi>head,</hi> to its <hi>Saints</hi> and <hi>Idols,</hi> have reſpect of a figure, and the thing figured to the homage, which the people of the world did render to ancient <hi>Rome,</hi> whoſe Citizenſhip they did under-hand labour for, and whose <hi>Eagles</hi> and other military Enſigns they <hi>worshipt.</hi>

                           <hi>Antichriſt</hi> is a falſe Chriſt; he is a falſe <hi>Image</hi> of him. Now 'tis of the eſſence of falſe <hi>Images,</hi> to have
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:95320:157"/>ſomething that imitates the things for which they would paſs.<note place="margin">A parallel between what Jeſus Chriſt is, and what the Pope pretends to be, or is.</note> 
                           <hi>Firſt, Jeſus Chriſt</hi> is the Holy of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies; <hi>Antichriſt</hi> calls himſelf <hi>his Holineſs, and moſt holy Lord. Secondly, Jeſus Chriſt</hi> is the true Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom of the Church; <hi>Antichriſt</hi> aſſumes the name of the ſecond Bridegroom. <hi>Thirdly, Jeſus Chriſt</hi> is the Vicar and Lievtenant of the Father, ſent on the Earth to act in his name. Our <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt</hi> alſo calls himſelf the Vicar of Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>Fourthly, Jeſus Chriſt</hi> is he who opens, and no man ſhuts; 'tis he that diſtributes the indulgence of his Father, and gives remiſſion of ſins. <hi>Antichriſt</hi> arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates the ſame rights to himſelf. <hi>Fifthly, I. Chriſt</hi> was promiſed by the Prophets: ſo <hi>Antichriſt</hi> hath been fore-told. <hi>6ly, Ieſus Chriſt</hi> was deſcribed by ſuch lively ſtrokes, that it was almoſt impoſſible not to know him; for is there any thing more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs than the 53<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Ch. of <hi>Eſai,</hi> &amp; the 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>Daniel?</hi> Yet he was not known. <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> though ſo exactly deſcribed as we have ſeen, was not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by them that nouriſht him in their boſom. <hi>7ly,</hi> The coming of <hi>I. Chriſt</hi> was mark'd by a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance ſo notable, that one could not but know it. 'Tis the deſtruction of the <hi>Iewiſh</hi> nation. <hi>Shiloh was to come, when the Law-giver, and the Scepter were departed from Iudah.</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Gen. 49.</note> The coming of <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt</hi> was mark'd by the ruin of the temporal <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Empire;</hi> a circumſtance ſo remarkable, that all the World saw it. <hi>8ly, I. Chriſt</hi> was expected at the time when he came. The <hi>Iews</hi> perceived, that the time of the fulfilling the Oracles did draw nigh, they reckon'd up the 70 <hi>weeks,</hi> and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended that the end of them could not be far off. The <hi>Chriſtians</hi> expected <hi>Antichriſt</hi> at the time when he was revealed. We learn it from <hi>St. Ierom,</hi> who ſeeing the <hi>Empire</hi> run to ruin by the invaſion of

                        </p>
                        <p>That which is more admirable in this <hi>parallel,</hi> is, that <hi>I. Chriſt</hi> and <hi>Antichriſt</hi> were not known almost for the very same reaſons.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">The figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative high ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions are the cauſe why Chriſt and Antichriſt are not known.</note>The <hi>Prophecies</hi> that were designed to make known <hi>I. Chriſt,</hi> were in part the cause why he was not acknowledged. For if in ſome places he be repreſented to us in his natural and true eſtate, in others he is repreſented in lively &amp; bright colours, with magnificent and pompous figures. So that by theſe deſcriptions one would have taken him for a <hi>King</hi> of this World, and his <hi>Empire</hi> for an earthly one. The <hi>Iews</hi> ſtretching theſe deſcriptions of the H. Spirit, not comprehending the ſenſe of them, and not entring into the meaning of thoſe figures, had an Idea of the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> quite different from what in truth he was to be in his firſt coming. In like manner the <hi>Prophecies</hi> concerning <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> are expreſt ſometimes in terms plain and natural enough, but at other times in high terms borrowed from the moſt hideous objects that are in the Old Teſtament, of <hi>Sodom, Egypt, Babylon, the apoſtacy, a revolt</hi> from the faith, <hi>the Doctrine of Daemons, the Cup of abominations, adulteries, whoredoms;</hi> every thing is brought in here, and upon theſe high ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions men have stretcht the Idea of <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The two comings of <hi>I. Chriſt,</hi> that gave occaſion
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:95320:158"/>to theſe two ſorts of <hi>Prophecies,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">The chief reaſon why <hi>Antichriſt</hi> was not known, was the means of his original, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his growth.</note> were the occaſion of the miſtake. <hi>I. Chriſt</hi> was to come in a ſtate of humiliation and abaſement, and he muſt come in a ſtate of grandeur and glory. The <hi>Prophets</hi> often ſpeak of this laſt ſtate, the <hi>Iews</hi> give heed only to this ſort of <hi>Prophecies</hi> and neglect the others, affix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to another ſubject. The two degrees of <hi>Antichriſt's</hi> coming have done the ſame thing. The <hi>Antichriſtian Empire</hi> in its beginning was low, creeping, its firſt years did ſavour of weakneſs and infancy. The <hi>malice,</hi> the <hi>corruption,</hi> the <hi>pride,</hi> the <hi>tyranny,</hi> the <hi>Idolatry</hi> of this <hi>Empire,</hi> were but in their beginning, they were buds and the firſt draughts, which men did not perceive.</p>
                        <p>And this is the great reaſon why <hi>Antichriſt</hi> hath not been known. If the <hi>Papiſm</hi> in the fourth age had endeavoured to introduce into the <hi>Church,</hi> both the <hi>tyranny</hi> of the <hi>Biſhop of Rome,</hi> and the <hi>idolatrous worship</hi> of the creatures, ſuch as it was afterwards, all the world would have revolted from him, and the <hi>Antichriſtianiſm</hi> would eaſily have been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd. But in that way that the Devil took, it was impoſſible that it ſhould not ſucceed. The firſt degree of <hi>tyranny</hi> and <hi>ſuperſtition</hi> was ſo ſmall, that though it was new, yet it was not at all perceived. What evil could one imagine, for inſtance, in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a reſpect for the memory of the <hi>Martyrs,</hi> and making an honourable mention of them in the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebration of the myſteries? How could one have been on ones guard, when nothing was treated of a yet, but ſome honour of <hi>precedency</hi> between a <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop</hi> and a <hi>Prieſt;</hi> and between a <hi>Bishop</hi> of one <hi>ſee</hi> and of another? I am alſo ſure that the <hi>myſtery of iniquity</hi> was advanced by ways where the Apoſtles had no ſuſpicion of evil. For inſtance, it was the cuſtome in the Apoſtles time ſometimes to hold
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:95320:159"/>their aſſemblies in the <hi>Dormitories</hi> and on the <hi>tombs</hi> of the <hi>martyrs.</hi> I believe, 'tis to this that <hi>Saint Paul</hi> referrs, in that famous paſſage in the 15<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of the firſt Epiſt. to the <hi>Corint. If the dead riſe not, why are they then haptized for the dead?</hi> That is to say, to what purpoſe do you honour the <hi>martyrs,</hi> ſo as to cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brare the myſteries on their <hi>tombs,</hi> if they are no longer any thing,<note place="margin">This did appear the moſt inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent thing in the world.</note> and muſt never return? <hi>a</hi> To pray to God in a <hi>Dormitory,</hi> and upon the <hi>tomb</hi> of a dead man, to testify that one would dye in the same faith wherein the <hi>Martyr</hi> died? Yet this was the firſt fountain of the <hi>popish Idolatry</hi> about Saints. From the firſt degree to the ſecond, there is but one ſtep; in like manner the paſſage is inſenſible from the ſecond to the third. And men found themſelves ſunk down into <hi>ſuperſtition,</hi> and swallowed up in <hi>tyranny,</hi> without perceiving it, and without its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing poſſible for them to perceive it. When cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions are inſenſible in their progreſs, thoſe that are engaged in them, cannot know them. They muſt be without. When one is carried in a veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, one doth not perceive its motion, one muſt be out of the veſſel and in a fixed point to diſcern it. In this manner it was, that the Devil laboured about this <hi>myſtery of iniquity</hi> in the time of <hi>St. Paul; he began to work,</hi> as he ſpeaks, he began with vending a little wicked Philoſophy about the mediation and interceſſion of <hi>Angels:</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Coloſſ. 2.</note> 
                           <hi>Platonick Philoſophy,</hi> which is the very ſame that the Apoſtle calls <hi>the Doctrine of Daemons;</hi> by which ſome would intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the ſerving of Angles, from which <hi>Saint Paul</hi> would remove the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Ch. 2. v. 8.</note> in saying to them, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware leſt any man ſpoil you through Philoſophy and vain deceit,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">v. 18.</note> 
                           <hi>after the tradition of men,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Let no man beguile you of your reward in a voluntary humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and worshipping of Angels, intruding into thoſe
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:95320:159" rendition="simple:additions"/>things, which he hath not ſeen.</hi> Satan alſo beat out a path for <hi>tyranny</hi> by thoſe diſputes for <hi>precedency</hi> and <hi>honours;</hi> of which we may ſee a pattern in the differences that reign'd in the <hi>Church of Corinth,</hi> where one ſaid; I am of <hi>Apollo,</hi> I am of <hi>Paul,</hi> and I am of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> But who would have ſuſpected, that things could have gone ſo far, as they have ſince proceeded?</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">The falſe Idea which the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients had of <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was revealed, hath been one cauſe of <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt</hi>'s not being known when he did come.</note>
                           <hi>Laſtly,</hi> The ancient Writers, and the prejudices which men took from their errours and overſights, did mightily ſerve to the cauſing <hi>Antichriſt</hi> not to be known.

<pb n="270" facs="tcp:95320:160"/>for three <hi>years</hi> and a <hi>half,</hi> which are the <hi>days</hi> of <hi>Antichriſt.</hi> There was no colour for making <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> ſojourn on the Earth 1260. <hi>years.</hi> So that it was neceſſary to take the 1260 <hi>years,</hi> of which the <hi>Revelation</hi> ſpeaks, for ſo many natural <hi>days,</hi> which make three natural <hi>years</hi> and a <hi>half.</hi> The name of <hi>Antichriſt</hi> made them believe he would call himſelf <hi>Chriſt.</hi> The <hi>Temple of God,</hi> where <hi>St. Paul</hi> saith, that the son of perdition muſt ſit, hath made them think of the <hi>Temple of Solomon,</hi> and they have concluded that <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was to be the ſeat of this <hi>Empire.</hi> Conſequently that <hi>Antichriſt</hi> muſt be a <hi>Jew;</hi> and for the reaſons we have obſerv'd above, he muſt moreover be of the tribe of <hi>Dan,</hi> and by conſequence a ſingle perſon. Behold the viſions which <hi>St.Irenaeus</hi> vends in his fifth book against <hi>Hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies;</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Why <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt</hi> was not known fooner.

                           <note place="margin">The im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance of this queſtion, whether <hi>Antichriſt</hi> muſt reign 1260 days, or 1260 years.</note>The <hi>Roman Church</hi> ſuppoſeth, that this dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion cannot be above three years and a half, <hi>i. e.</hi> 1260. <hi>natural days;</hi> and we pretend, this muſt be underſtood of 1260. <hi>prophetical days,</hi> which are 1260. <hi>years.</hi> 'Tis ſo important a matter, that on this all the reſt depends. If this ſuppoſition of the duration of <hi>Antichriſt</hi> meerly and ſimply for <hi>three years and a half,</hi> be falſe, all that the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Church</hi> ſaith of <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> is falſe.

                        <p n="1">I. That the duration of the 1260. <hi>days,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the woman in the 12<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chapt. of the <hi>Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> muſt be fed in the deſart; which is alſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the ſame place <hi>a time,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">The 1260 days. The 42 months. The three years and half; a time, times, and half a time are the same po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod.</note> 
                           <hi>times, and half a time:</hi> The 42 <hi>months,</hi> during which the <hi>Court</hi> muſt be left to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> according to what is ſaid in the 11<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chap. The 1260 <hi>days,</hi> during which the <hi>two witneſſes</hi> are to prophecy clothed in ſack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth, as 'tis fore-told in the same 11<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chapter. And laſtly, the 42. <hi>months</hi> given to the firſt <hi>beaſt</hi>
                           <pb n="5" facs="tcp:95320:163"/>of the 13<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chapter of the <hi>Revel.</hi> to excerciſe his power. All theſe different periods, I ſay, are one and the ſame period, and ſignify the duration of the <hi>Antichriſtian Empire.</hi> This can't be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſputed.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>ſecond</hi> principle is this, that in that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy, the <hi>days,</hi> the <hi>years,</hi> and the <hi>months,</hi> may be taken for <hi>natural</hi> days, months, and years; or for <hi>prophetical</hi> ones, a <hi>day</hi> for a <hi>year.</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Sometimes the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets count the time as other men do.</note> This might ſignify natural days: for ſometimes the Prophets do ſo ſpeak; they reckon the time as other men do. <hi>Jeremy</hi> reckon'd 70 <hi>years</hi> for the duration of the captivity; and these years are natural ones. 'Tis certain alſo, that in the period of the <hi>thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years,</hi> deſigned for the reign of the <hi>Church</hi> after the deſtruction of <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> the years are taken for <hi>natural</hi> years.</p>
                        <p>But it is not leſs certain,<note place="margin">The <hi>Papiſts</hi> cannot deny, but that the 1260 <hi>days</hi> may ſignify 1260 <hi>years.</hi> Chap. 9. Chap. 4. v. 4.6.</note> that theſe days and theſe years may be taken myſtically for <hi>propheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> days and years. 'Tis confeſt, that the 70 <hi>weeks</hi> of <hi>Daniel</hi> ſignify 70 weeks of years. God ſaid to <hi>Ezekiel, Thou shalt ſleep on thy left ſide, and lay the iniquity of the houſe of Iſrael upon it; according to the number of the days that thou shalt lye upon it, thou shalt bear their iniquity. I have appointed thee each day for a year.</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Numb. 14.34.</note> God said to the Iſraelites, <hi>according to the number of the days in which ye ſearched the Land, even</hi> 40 <hi>days, each day for a year, shall you bear your iniquities, even</hi> 40 <hi>years.</hi> This could not be obſcure to the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> who were accuſtom'd to this ſtyle; and who knew there were weeks of years in their <hi>Calendar,</hi> as well as weeks of days; and that a week of years anſwered to that of days, one year for one day?</p>
                        <p>The <hi>third</hi> principle is this, that here the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of three <hi>years</hi> and a <hi>half,</hi> 42 <hi>months,</hi> and 1260
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:95320:164"/>
                           <hi>days,</hi> cannot ſignify an <hi>indefinite time.</hi> As it ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times happens,<note place="margin">The num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber 1260 muſt be a definite number, not an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>definite one.</note> that the Holy Spirit by a determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate number means an undetermin'd one. A way that would be extreamly advantagious to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſans of <hi>Rome.</hi> For when one ſhall have demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated, that 'tis abſolutely impoſſible, that that which is predicted concerning the <hi>Antichriſtian Empire,</hi> can be fulfilled in the compaſs of three <hi>years</hi> and a <hi>half,</hi> it would be very uſeful for them, if they could ſay, we muſt not take this ſo strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the literal ſenſe; that it may ſignify three times ten, three times twenty, or more, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as the Holy Spirit oftentimes means an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>definite <hi>number</hi> by a definite one. But here that cannot be. There are certain <hi>numbers</hi> by which the <hi>Prophets</hi> uſe to deſcribe an indefinite time, by reason of a certain priviledge thoſe numbers have. As that of three, becauſe 'tis the firſt odd number, &amp; the number of the perſons of the <hi>Trinity;</hi> that of ſeven, becauſe of the ſeven <hi>days</hi> of the <hi>creation;</hi> that of twelve, becauſe of the twelve <hi>Patriarchs,</hi> the twelve <hi>Tribes,</hi> and the twelve <hi>Apoſtles;</hi> that of 100, and that of 1000, becauſe theſe are num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, that according to the cuſtome of men, are often deſigned to ſignify a great undetermin'd quantity. But we ſhall not find any examples of broken <hi>numbers,</hi> as that of three and a half, of 42, and 1260 taken for indefinite numbers. 'Tis true, the <hi>Revelation</hi> ſpeaks of the 144 thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand sealed ones. Now the number of 144, is not leſs a broken one than that of 42. But 'tis, becauſe 144 is the product of that of 12 multiplied by it ſelf. The Holy Spirit takes twelve thouſand ſealed perſons of every <hi>Tribe,</hi> 12 times 12 make 144. Here a reaſon can't be given, why God ſhould chooſe 1260 <hi>days</hi> to mark out an indefinite
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:95320:164"/>time. There is no middle way therefore; they muſt be ſo many <hi>years,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">It muſt be 1260 <hi>years,</hi> or 1260 <hi>days,</hi> and no more.</note> or ſo many ſimple <hi>days.</hi> So that when we ſhall have proved, that the courſe of this <hi>Empire</hi> is not three <hi>years</hi> and a <hi>half,</hi> we ſhall have proved alſo that 'tis 1260 <hi>years.</hi> To prove that 'tis not three <hi>years</hi> and a <hi>half,</hi> we need but run through the <hi>Hiſtory</hi> of this <hi>Empire,</hi> according as we find it in the book of the <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</hi>

                           <note place="margin">The firſt Argument againſt the three years and half. One half of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation</hi> would be taken up, in giving an account of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents of only three years and a half.</note>
                           <hi>Firſt</hi> of all we muſt know, that according to the greateſt part of <hi>Interpreters,</hi> almoſt the whole <hi>Revelation</hi> is ſpent in fore-telling us, and ſetting in order the events that muſt happen to the <hi>Church</hi> during this reign of <hi>Antichriſt.</hi> At leaſt, it is certain, that 'tis the ſubject of one half of this book: the 11<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 13<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 14<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 15<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 16<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 17<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 18<hi rend="sup">th</hi> and 19<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chapters contain the <hi>birth, progreſs, finishing, ruin,</hi> and <hi>fall</hi> of this <hi>Antichriſtian King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</hi> Let any one judge, if there be any likely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, that this only <hi>prophetical book,</hi> which the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> have left us for the time of the <hi>N. Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> moves but upon three <hi>years</hi> and a <hi>half,</hi> and hath omitted the events of almoſt two thouſand <hi>years.</hi> So that the general Idea of this <hi>Prophecy</hi> can't bear this imagination; but let us come to particulars.</p>

                           <note place="margin">Second Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, theſe three years and a half can't agree with what is ſaid of the <hi>firſt beaſt</hi> in the 13th Chap. of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation.</hi>

                           <hi>Second,</hi> The 11<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chapt. begins to ſpeak of this <hi>Antichriſtian Empire;</hi> but becauſe this is but as a general Hiſtory, and an abridgement, 'tis in this general account, that the viſion of the three <hi>years and a half</hi> is hid, and 'tis from hence it hath been taken. Let us ſee if this can agree with the places where the Prophet enlargeth this ſhort deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption. We have in the 13<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chap. a repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this <hi>Empire</hi> under the emblems of two <hi>beaſts,</hi> of which one had ſeven <hi>heads</hi> and ten
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:95320:165"/>
                           <hi>horns,</hi> and the other but one <hi>head</hi> and two <hi>horns.</hi> We there ſee in the firſt place a beaſt with ſeven <hi>heads</hi> and ten <hi>horns.</hi> It hath been confeſſed to us, that this is <hi>Antichriſt.</hi> We have proved, that the word <hi>beaſt</hi> ſignifies an Empire, conſiſting of a <hi>founder</hi> and his <hi>ſucceſſors.</hi> Now ſee a fine ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, and a very conſiderable time, that ſame of three <hi>years and a half,</hi> to be called an <hi>Empire,</hi> and to be meant by a <hi>beaſt.</hi> Certainly this beaſt with ſeven <hi>heads</hi> and ten <hi>horns,</hi> is the <hi>Roman Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire</hi> in its whole extent, from its founder <hi>Romu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> even to <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> who muſt be according to <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> the laſt <hi>Roman Enperour,</hi> though without the <hi>name</hi> of a <hi>Roman Emperour.</hi> And this <hi>Roman Empire</hi> is brought in anew expreſly, for the ſeventh <hi>head</hi> with ten <hi>horns,</hi> which make <hi>Antichriſt, i. e.</hi> the ten <hi>Kings</hi> his vaſſals, which give him their power. In truth, <hi>three years and a half</hi> would they well deſerve, that the Holy Spirit ſhould repreſent them to us, and lay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our eyes afreſh, all this great <hi>Empire</hi> of almoſt 3000 <hi>years</hi> duration? For by the confeſſion of our adverſaries, the <hi>Roman Empire</hi> doth yet laſt, and ſhall continue even to <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> who shall be the laſt King of it. Now there is about two thouſand four or five hundred <hi>years</hi> ſince the firſt foundation of <hi>Rome.</hi> Moreover <hi>Antichriſt</hi> is the ſeventh <hi>head</hi> of the <hi>Roman Empire.</hi> This is ſo evident, that it can't be gain-ſayed. Now muſt there not be ſome proportion between the <hi>heads</hi> and their <hi>durations?</hi> The <hi>head</hi> of the <hi>Kings</hi> laſted near 200 <hi>years,</hi> that of the <hi>Emperors</hi> above 500 <hi>years:</hi> what proportion is there between ſo long a duration, and this of <hi>three years and a half?</hi> As for us, we pretend, that the laſt <hi>head</hi> muſt endure as long as the other ſix. <hi>Rome</hi> under <hi>Kings, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuls,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:95320:165"/>Decemvirs, Tribunes</hi> of the people, perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual <hi>Dictators,</hi> and <hi>Emperors</hi> hath laſted about 1250 <hi>years;</hi> it muſt be as long under the <hi>Popes.</hi> But at leaſt, the <hi>head</hi> of <hi>Antichriſt</hi> ſhould laſt at <hi>Rome</hi> ſome ages, to have its duration propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable to that of the other <hi>heads.</hi> It ſignifies nothing to us what period is aſſigned to it, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided it be not that of <hi>three natural years and a half.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>For we have proved that if it can't be taken for three <hi>natural</hi> years and a half, it muſt neceſſarily be taken for <hi>prophetical</hi> years.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">Third Arg. in three years and a half <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt</hi> can't prevail over the Nations of the earth, neither by violence, nor by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing them.</note>
                           <hi>Thirdly,</hi> In the ſame Chapter, the ſame <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian Empire</hi> appears again under the form of a ſecond <hi>beaſt,</hi> that hath but one <hi>head</hi> and two <hi>horns.</hi> Yet once more, ſee a great myſtery, for a matter that is to endure but <hi>three years and a half,</hi> in a period of 2000 <hi>years.</hi> Of the firſt <hi>beaſt</hi> the Prophet ſaith, that <hi>it was given to him to make war with the Saints, and to overcome them; and alſo to him was given power over every Tribe, Tongue and Nation.</hi> And of the ſecond, that he ſhould <hi>deceive them that dwell on the Earth, by reaſon of thoſe miracles, which he had power to do,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and that all, both ſmall and great, free and bond should receive his mark in their hand, and in their fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads.</hi> Afterwards 'tis ſaid of this <hi>Antichriſtian Empire,</hi> under the emblem of a woman ſitting on a beaſt with ſeven heads and ten horns, that <hi>all the Kings of the Earth have committed whoredom with her, that she made drunk all the Inhabitants of the Earth with the wine of her whoredoms, and that all the Nations drank of the wine of her whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</hi> This ſignifies two things; one, that this <hi>Antichriſtian Empire</hi> muſt ſubdue all Nations; the ſecond, that it muſt ſeduce them by its ſigns
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:95320:166"/>and falſe miracles. Now can any one imagine, that <hi>three years and a half</hi> ſuffice, firſt to conquer an <hi>Empire</hi> and overcome all <hi>Nations;</hi> ſecondly, to ſeduce and pervert them, and bring them to deny the <hi>Chriſtian Religion.</hi> If <hi>Antichriſt</hi> were to uſe that method that is uſed in <hi>France,</hi> and were to uſe no other but that, it may be in <hi>three years and a half,</hi> he could make many <hi>Kingdoms</hi> abjure <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity,</hi> as in <hi>ſix months</hi> he hath made the <hi>refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation</hi> be abjured by more than a <hi>million of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</hi> But 'tis plain, the <hi>Antichriſt</hi> of the <hi>Papiſts</hi> is not to uſe this way. So that one may ſay, <hi>the Clergy of France</hi> have outſtript their <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> and that there never was a more helliſh ſort of <hi>perſecution.</hi> It is clear, I ſay, that <hi>Antichriſt</hi> is to carry away men by ſeducing them; for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, why ſhould he work <hi>ſigns and miracles?</hi> and though he were to pervert the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> with <hi>Dragoons,</hi> at leaſt certainly he ought to have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd them by arms before hand, and have over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd every other Empire. Can he conquer all the World in <hi>three years?</hi> where are the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of ſo ſwift a conqueſt? <hi>Alexander the Great</hi> is repreſented in the viſion of the four <hi>Beaſts,</hi> as a <hi>Leopard,</hi> by reaſon of the ſpeedineſs of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts. Yet he ſpent more than three <hi>years</hi> and a <hi>half,</hi> and had conquer'd but one part of <hi>Aſia</hi> when he died. Are three years and a half ſufficient to reaſſemble the <hi>Jews</hi> from all the Countries of the World, to make them <hi>maſters</hi> of the whole <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe,</hi> to re-eſtabliſh the <hi>moſaical worship,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>build the <hi>Temple</hi> of <hi>Solomon?</hi> Only the building of the <hi>Temple</hi> the firſt time, took up ſeven <hi>years.</hi> The labour'd more than 40 years about that of <hi>Herod;</hi> and this of <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> which will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently be more magnificent, ſhall be finiſht in a
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:95320:166"/>few <hi>months.</hi> If there were therefore nothing elſe but what were to be done by the <hi>violence of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt,</hi> according to the very ſuppoſition of the <hi>popish Doctors,</hi> it would be impoſſible to be done in 30 <hi>years.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>How much more impoſſible is it, that he ſhould attain his end in ſo ſhort a time, in what he is to do by the means of <hi>ſeducing?</hi> His falſe Prophet muſt ſeduce all the inhabitants of the Earth, <hi>i. e.</hi> all the Subjects of the <hi>Roman Empire,</hi> according to the ſtyle of the Writers in thoſe times, who defined the <hi>Roman Empire</hi> by the habitable earth. There muſt be much more time to <hi>ſeduce</hi> the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions than to <hi>conquer</hi> them. If <hi>Antichriſt</hi> was to eſtabliſh his <hi>Religion</hi> by <hi>violence</hi> only, it might be ſaid that in building up his <hi>Empire</hi> he would build up his <hi>Religion;</hi> but it is clearer than the day, that he muſt <hi>perſwade and ſeduce.</hi> 'Tis for this purpoſe that he worketh <hi>Signs.</hi> There's no need of <hi>miracles</hi> to eſtabliſh a Religion by <hi>arms.</hi> The Prophecy ſaith expreſly, that <hi>he shall make drunk the Nations of the Earth with the wine of his whoredoms.</hi> Which ſignifies great obſtinacy, drunkeneſs of mind, perſwaſion.

<pb n="12" facs="tcp:95320:167"/>of his laſt ruin; the firſt is called the <hi>harveſt. Then he that ſate on the Cloud thruſt in his ſickle on the Earth,<note place="margin">c. 14.8.</note> and the Earth was reaped.</hi>
                           <note place="margin">v. 16.</note> The ſecond is called the <hi>vintage.</hi>
                           <note place="margin">v. 19.</note> 
                           <hi>And the other Angel thruſt in his ſickle into the Earth, and gathered the Vine of the Earth, and caſt it into the great wine-preſs of the wrath of God.</hi> It is plain, at leaſt, that theſe two <hi>periods</hi> muſt be <hi>diſtant</hi> one from the other, as much as ordinarily the harveſt is from the vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. Now 'tis well known, that the prophecies repreſent in a <hi>little,</hi> what the events ſhew in the <hi>great;</hi> and conſequently as the harveſt is many days diſtant from the vintage, it will be neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that the two parts of the fall of the <hi>Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Empire,</hi> ſhould be many years diſtant one from the other. Now if meerly the <hi>fall</hi> of the <hi>Babylonish Empire</hi> takes up <hi>many years,</hi> the <hi>flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing and the ſtrength</hi> of this Empire muſt take up much <hi>more time.</hi> An Empire ſo ſtrong, can't be ruin'd in the <hi>twinckling of an eye,</hi> and in <hi>one months</hi> time. Moreover, there muſt be an <hi>interval</hi> of reſt <hi>between</hi> the harveſt and the vintage. All this neceſſarily ſuppoſeth more than <hi>three years and a half.</hi>

                        <p>The 15<hi rend="sup">th</hi> and 16<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chapt. contain the viſion of the <hi>ſeven viols</hi> of the wrath of God, that muſt be poured out on the Earth. It is evident that all theſe ſeven viols reſpect the <hi>Antichriſtian Empire.</hi> The firſt plague is an ulcer, that ſeizes on the <hi>men that had the mark of the beaſt.</hi>
                           <note place="margin">c. 16.2.</note> The 15<hi rend="sup">th</hi> viol is <hi>caſt on the ſeat of the beaſt;</hi>

                           <hi>is divided into three parts.</hi> And before the viols were given to the ſeven Angels, <hi>they that had obtained victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry over the beaſt, over his image, over his mark, and over his name,</hi> are repreſented as rejoycing in
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:95320:167"/>the preſence of the ſeven Angels, that had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the ſeven plagues.</p>

                           <hi>Fifthly,</hi> All this makes it appear, that theſe <hi>ſeven viols</hi> are <hi>ſeven periods,</hi> included in the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of <hi>Antichriſts Empire,</hi> under which God muſt pour out his terrible judgements on that Empire.

This is very plainly abſurd. There is no example of the like matter in all the Prophecies. The <hi>ſeven ſeals,</hi> the <hi>ſeven trumpets</hi> of the <hi>Revelation</hi> contain <hi>many ages;</hi> 'tis ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous to ſuppoſe that the <hi>ſeven viols</hi> contain but <hi>ſome months.</hi> We ſhall ſee afterward, that every <hi>viol</hi> extends it ſelf to more than a 100 <hi>years.</hi>

                        <p>I Draw my laſt Argument againſt this chimeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal duration of <hi>three years and a half,</hi> from the moſt famous of all the types of <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> viz. <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes.</hi> 'Tis he that perſecuted the <hi>Church,</hi> that oppreſſed it, that defiled the <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> that cauſed the daily <hi>ſacrifice</hi> to ceaſe for the ſpace of <hi>three natural years and a half.</hi> Wherein it is evident, that God hath ſet him as a type of <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> who during the ſpace of <hi>three prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical years and a half,</hi> was in like manner to ſeize on the <hi>Church,</hi> to fill the <hi>Temple</hi> of God with <hi>Idols,</hi> and make the pure ſervice of God, the continual ſacrifices of praiſes and prayers, which God hath reſerved for himſelf alone, to <hi>ceaſe.</hi> Now we muſt remember this maxime, which we have already advanced in the fore-going Chapter, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>types</hi> are oenigmatical, and <hi>short</hi> pictures of great events, great in their <hi>extent</hi> as well as in their <hi>qualities.</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Types are short pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures in a little.</note> This maxime is evident, it hath no need of proofs. And according to this principle, ſeeing the <hi>times</hi> muſt be ſhort, as well as the other
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:95320:170"/>ſtrokes, it is clear, that <hi>contracted years</hi> cannot be better repreſented than by <hi>days,</hi> not by <hi>months,</hi> for a month is the <hi>revolution</hi> of the <hi>Moon,</hi> and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently it can't be proper to repreſent the <hi>revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution</hi> of the <hi>Sun,</hi> which is a quite different <hi>Star.</hi> But the <hi>day</hi> and the <hi>year</hi> are the revolutions of the <hi>Sun;</hi> the <hi>year</hi> is the <hi>great</hi> revolution, the <hi>day</hi> the <hi>little</hi> one. If one would repreſent in ſhort the <hi>great revolution</hi> of the <hi>Sun,</hi> one can't do it better than by the <hi>ſmall revolution</hi> of the <hi>ſame</hi> Star. And thence I conclude, that the oppreſſion of the Church by <hi>Antiochus,</hi> who was the <hi>type,</hi> having laſted 1260 <hi>little revolutions</hi> of the <hi>Sun,</hi> they muſt repreſent <hi>ſo many</hi> of the <hi>great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volutions</hi> of the ſame <hi>Star.</hi> I ſpend a Chapter on this laſt proof, becauſe in the duration of the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of the <hi>Jewish Church</hi> by <hi>Antiochus Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanes,</hi> there are conſiderable difficulties, which ſpring from the differences of the <hi>Prophecies</hi> of <hi>Daniel</hi> and the events, ſuch as the <hi>firſt</hi> book of the <hi>Macchabees</hi> repreſents them to us. I hope that the clearing theſe difficulties about the duration of the perſecution of <hi>Antiochus,</hi> will give us ſuch light into the duration of the Kingdom of <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt,</hi> as will pleaſe the curious.</p>

From the time that the abomination of deſolation shall be ſet up, shall be</hi> 1290 <hi>days,</hi> which are <hi>three years</hi> and <hi>ſeven months,</hi> that is to ſay, ſince the prophanation of the <hi>Temple</hi> to the finiſhing its purification.</p>
                        <p>But after the finiſhing this purification, the <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> was not yet in a condition to ſacrifice in. For they were fain to build a <hi>new Altar,</hi> and make utenſils all new, in the place of thoſe that had been either taken away, or prophaned.</p>
                        <p>To do this, no leſs than 45 <hi>days</hi> were neceſſary; and theſe are the 45 <hi>days</hi> added to 1290, that make the number 1335 <hi>days,</hi> of which the Prophet ſaith, <hi>Bleſſed is he that waiteth, and cometh to the</hi> 1335 <hi>days.</hi> And 'tis at the end of theſe 1335 <hi>days,</hi> reckoning from the prophanation in the beginning of the <hi>year</hi> 148, that the dedication was made in the <hi>year</hi> 148. on the 25<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                           <hi>day</hi> of the ninth <hi>month.</hi> Therefore 'tis the Prophet cries out, <hi>Bleſſed is he,</hi> &amp;c. becauſe it was a great feaſt, and great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing in <hi>Iſrael.</hi> See, I ſay, both the <hi>Hiſtory</hi> and the <hi>Chronology,</hi> and the duration of the ceſſation, of the prophanation of the <hi>Temple,</hi> and the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of the daily ſacrifice, made to agree with the <hi>Prophecy.</hi>

The cleanſing of the <hi>Church</hi> muſt be begun, the <hi>Idol</hi> muſt be caſt out, the <hi>Tyrant</hi> expelled after the 1260 <hi>years.</hi> But as <hi>Judas Macchabaeus</hi> ſpent 30 <hi>days</hi> about purifying the <hi>Temple,</hi> after he had taken away the <hi>Idol</hi> thence, and had reſcued it out of the hands of the <hi>Tyrant;</hi> 'tis propable, that <hi>after</hi> the fall of the <hi>Papiſm,</hi> of its <hi>tyranny,</hi> and <hi>idolatry,</hi> 30 <hi>years more</hi> will be ſpent in purifying the <hi>Church</hi> from all <hi>ſchiſms, hereſies, diviſions</hi> and <hi>etrours.</hi>

The <hi>Saracens, Arabians,</hi> and <hi>Turks,</hi> the founders and preſervers of this Sect, <hi>never were Chriſtians,</hi> and are <hi>not Apoſtates.

Twelfthly, Antichriſt</hi> muſt have <hi>two horns,</hi> i. e. <hi>two powers like to the Lamb.</hi> 'Tis notorious, the <hi>Mahometans</hi> have <hi>nothing</hi> in common with <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> with <hi>his Religion,</hi> and with <hi>his power. Thirteenth, Antichriſt</hi> muſt <hi>excommunicate, perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute, take away liberty of commerce</hi> from all thoſe that will not take on them <hi>his name and his

Fourteenth,</hi> The <hi>Antichriſtian Empire</hi> muſt be <hi>a head,</hi> i. e. a Kingdom <hi>hurt with a deadly wound, and revive again.</hi> This can by no means agree to <hi>Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taniſm,</hi> which is a <hi>Religion wholly new,</hi> and which hath formed <hi>Empires wholly new.</hi> It was neceſſary to make theſe obſervations againſt thoſe, that great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſiring to take <hi>Antichriſt</hi> from <hi>Rome,</hi> would fain place him among the <hi>Mahometans.</hi>

Rev. 17.12.</note>But the principal reaſon, why God would not have us count the birth of <hi>Antichriſtianiſm</hi> from the years 360, and 393, is, becauſe there was <hi>a fourth Character</hi> of the birth of that <hi>Antichriſtian Empire,</hi> that had not yet happen'd; that is, the <hi>ten Kings, that were to take their power together with the Beaſt.</hi> Theſe <hi>ten Kings</hi> are <hi>ten Kingdoms,</hi> into which the <hi>Roman Empire</hi> was to be ſubdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided. <hi>And the ten horns which thou ſaweſt, are ten Kings, which have received no Kingdom as yet, but receive power as Kings one hour with the Beaſt.</hi> Theſe words are <hi>admirable;</hi> to me they appear <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs,</hi> and I am aſtoniſht, that it hath not been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that <hi>they preciſely mark the time,</hi> wherein we muſt <hi>begin</hi> to reckon the reign of the Beaſt.</p>

Eſpecially, if we conſider them with the words of St. <hi>Paul, he who now letteth,</hi> or <hi>poſſeſſeth, will let,</hi> or <hi>poſſeſs, untill he be taken out of the way; then shall that wicked one be revealed.</hi> That is to ſay, till the time that the <hi>head</hi> of the <hi>Roman Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors</hi> be deſtroyed. Theſe two paſſages ſignify expreſly, from <hi>what time</hi> we muſt compute the 1260 years. 'Tis from the time, that the <hi>Goths, Vandals,</hi> &amp;c. after having a long time harraſſed, and rent the <hi>Roman Empire,</hi> at laſt <hi>divided it into ten pieces.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Moreover, the falſification of the tranſlation of the <hi>Port-Royal,</hi> that render it thus, <hi>the ten Kings shall take power</hi> for a little time <hi>with the Beaſt,</hi> would not deſtroy the evidence of the Oracle, though we ſhould ſuffer the ill tranſlation of theſe Gentlemen to paſs. For if we muſt tranſlate it <hi>for a little time,</hi> by that <hi>little time</hi> we muſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, the <hi>three years and a half</hi> of <hi>Antichriſt's</hi> duration.

                        </p>
                        <p>That which is eſſential here, and which the raſhneſs of men hath not been able to take away, is, that the <hi>ten Kings</hi> were to receive their power <hi>together with the Beaſt,</hi> that is to ſay, at <hi>the ſame time.</hi> Whethey it be for a <hi>short,</hi> or a <hi>long</hi> one; 'tis ſtill certain, that this Oracle plainly teaches us, that we muſt ſeek for the <hi>birth</hi> of the Antichriſtian Empire <hi>in the time when we find ten Kingdoms ariſe from the diſmembred Roman Empire.</hi> We muſt therefore ſee, when that was thus diſmembred.</p>

Genſeric</hi> King of the <hi>Vandals</hi> comes from <hi>Africk,</hi> being called in by the Empreſs <hi>Eudoxia</hi> to revenge the death of her husband.

They ſpent fifteen whole days in ſpoiling it of its treaſures. <hi>Genſeric</hi> tranſported them into <hi>Africa</hi> together with the Empreſs, her daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and the principal men of <hi>Rome.</hi> Juſt in the ſame manner as <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> carried away the veſſels of the Temple, and led the flower of the people into captivity. 'Tis aſſuredly <hi>from this very time,</hi> that we muſt compute the <hi>entire ruin of the Empire</hi> of the <hi>City of Rome,</hi> though it had ſtill a <hi>shadow</hi> of a Kingdom, under the <hi>images</hi> of Emperours, that laſted about twenty years. <hi>Jeremy</hi> reckons 70 <hi>years</hi> for the captivity of <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon.</hi> Yet it is certain, the <hi>from the laſt ruin of Jeruſalem</hi> till the <hi>return,</hi> there were <hi>not ſixty years.</hi> But the Prophet counts upon <hi>Jeruſalem as deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> and its Kingdom as entirely ruined <hi>from Jehoja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kim's time,</hi> under whom in truth was the firſt tranſportation of the people: And ſince whoſe time, the Kingdom of <hi>Judah</hi> under <hi>Zedekiah,</hi> was but a ſhadow of that of his Predeceſſors, becauſe he was the <hi>Chaldaeans</hi> vaſſal. On this account, I ſay, God reckons it for nothing. By the like reaſon, we muſt reckon for <hi>nothing</hi> thoſe petty <hi>Kings of Rome,</hi> who having as it were nothing

'Tis certainly that part of the <hi>Revelation</hi> that hath been leaſt underſtood; I mean, as to what reſpects the <hi>circumſtances</hi> of the ruin of the <hi>Antichriſtian Empire.</hi> For as for the <hi>Characters of that Empire,</hi> which are alſo contain'd in thoſe Chapters, they have been well enough ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended. But as to the <hi>fall</hi> of that Empire, the
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:95320:192"/>
                           <hi>time</hi> and progreſs of that fall, God would not let men hitherto be ſo happy in their conjectures. I hope, that in what I ſhall now ſay, ſomething ſhall be met with, that ſhall much more bear upon it the Characters of truth.</p>

But it hath not pleaſed God to give us all theſe circumſtances in <hi>one viſion,</hi> that ſo the Prophecy might not be too plain.

The fall of the <hi>Antichriſtian Empire,</hi> is the <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,</hi> that which is neceſſary to ſupport the hopes of the <hi>Church.</hi> Hence it is, that there is no ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecurity in the <hi>prophecy,</hi> with reſpect to <hi>this;</hi> no more then there was in the Prophecies concerning the Meſſiah, with reſpect to the ſubſtance of it, and the certainty of his coming; but there was much as to the circumſtances of that coming. Therefore,<note place="margin">God hath miſplaced the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances in the viſions, that they might be obſcure,</note> becauſe God was willing, that the circumſtances of <hi>the fall</hi> of the Kingdom of <hi>Antichriſt</hi> ſhould be obſcure; he hath for this reaſon divided them into ſeveral viſions.

He hath not placed the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances exactly, according to the order of their co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to paſs.

                           <note place="margin">God does ordinarily prepare for greater vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions by leſſer.</note>The fifteenth <hi>Chapter</hi> is nothing but a prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the viſion of the <hi>ſixteenth.</hi> Where are the ſeven laſt plagues (as the twelve firſt verſes of the 14<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, are nothing but a preparation unto the viſion of the <hi>harveſt</hi> and <hi>vintage,</hi>) which is very evident from the beginning of the 15<hi rend="sup">th</hi>

<pb n="65" facs="tcp:95320:193"/>as the red ſea, and its waves were the <hi>danger</hi> out of which the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> coming out of <hi>Egypt</hi> were deliver'd; ſo this <hi>ſea of glaſs mingled with fire,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents the <hi>evils</hi> which the Faithful who leave <hi>Babylon</hi> do eſcape. Theſe <hi>evils</hi> are called a <hi>ſea,</hi> on the account of their <hi>greatneſs</hi> and bitterneſs; <hi>my breach is great like the ſea,</hi> ſaid <hi>Jeremy:</hi> they are called <hi>a ſea of glaſs,</hi> or a ſea of ice, becauſe of their hardneſs. 'Tis more eaſy to eſcape out of a ſea of water, becauſe the liquidity of waters does make it poſſible to ſwim through them: but if a ſea was glaſs or ice, it would be impoſſible to get out of it. There is alſo fire <hi>mingled with</hi> glaſs, to repreſent the burning, and extream dolours of thoſe evils. <hi>Fire</hi> and <hi>Ice</hi> are two extreams in evil; yet they are joyn'd in the deſcription of the cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of the <hi>Church,</hi> though they ſeem inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent: if it be a ſea of ice, there cannot be fire there; and if there be fire, how can it ſubſiſt with ice? This is to expreſs, that the calamities of the <hi>Church</hi> are extream, and that they include all kinds of <hi>evils:</hi> There is Ice, that is Irreligion, a privation of the <hi>Fire</hi> of Piety: There is fire through the cruelty of perſecutions. 'Tis for this, that the Spirit uſed the term <hi>glaſs</hi> inſtead of <hi>ice;</hi> to ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy that it ſhould be a frozen ſea, which ſhould ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt with fire. I know not what they had in their thoughts, who have ſaid, that this ſea of glaſs ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified the Church. The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> who are eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped out of the ſpiritual <hi>Egypt,</hi> are repreſented up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſea of glaſs, that is, upon its <hi>shore,</hi> and as thoſe who come out of the water. In the ſtyle of the holy language, <hi>upon the river, upon the ſea,</hi> is, upon the ſhore of the river, and upon the ſhore of the ſea.</p>
                        <p>After this come out <hi>of the Temple, which is
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:95320:194"/>in Heaven,</hi> the ſeven Angels appointed to pour out the ſeven vials of the wrath of God. They are <hi>clothed in white,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">v. 6.</note> to denote their purity; <hi>they had their loins girt,</hi> after the faſhion of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients, who girt themſelves, when they made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ready for a combate, or any other difficult work.<note place="margin">v. 7.</note> One <hi>of the four beaſts gives to each of them one viol,</hi> a bottle out of which we pour into a cup. This Figure of ſpeaking is common, we pour out of a viol into a cup. Now a Cup in the <hi>figurative</hi> and <hi>Prophetick</hi> ſtyle, ſignifies the judgements of God, in alluſion unto that ſtupifying cup, which was given to Criminals condemned to dye, that they might be leſs ſenſible of the pain of their pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment. Or rather, which I judge more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, God in this viſion makes an alluſion to <hi>hour-glaſſes,</hi> in which water did run out, to mark the hours and duration of time; as now adays this is done by the running of ſand.

                           </note> I am fully perſwaded, that Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters have underſtood nothing of the meaning of this Chapter; Gods knows whether we ſhall be more happy, if we are miſtaken, as others are, this muſt be charged on us: if we light upon the truth, this muſt be aſcribed to God.

                        <p>All that others ſeem to have underſtood as to this <hi>Chapter,</hi> is, that it contains the Hiſtory of <hi>ſeven degrees,</hi> or <hi>ſeven periods,</hi> through which the <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian Kingdom</hi> ought to paſs before its fall; every period containing diſmal judgements of God, which are to afflict the <hi>Empire</hi> of the <hi>Beaſt.</hi> This carries ſuch evidence along with it, that it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt impoſſible not to ſee it; but yet, this hath been ſeen very confuſedly, and the application which hath been made, hath been very unhappy.
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:95320:195"/>Now ſince others have underſtood nothing of the ſenſe of this <hi>Chapter,</hi> we muſt not wonder that they have ſaid nothing pertinently concerning the <hi>fall</hi> of the <hi>Antichriſtian Empire,</hi> &amp; concerning the time in which it muſt come to paſs: for <hi>here</hi> is the Key of all, this is a compleat Hiſtory or <hi>its</hi> ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities.

The <hi>firſt</hi> is, to lay down certain Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, which muſt ſerve us as guides. The <hi>ſecond</hi> is, to do that very briefly, which I have omitted in other places. I mean, to relate the various Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations of Divines. For that which they have ſaid, is ſo far from the likeneſs of Truth, that it may be oppoſing my Commentaries and theirs eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be ſeen, who hath hit upon the truth.</p>

                           </note>The <hi>Principles</hi> are there:</p>
                        <p n="1">1. <hi>The pouring out of the viols, and the ſeveral plagues, which follow upon their effuſion, do cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly ſignify the judgements of God upon the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of</hi> Antichriſt: But we muſt not imagine that they are as ſo many ſteps, which ſenſibly carry it to its ruin. God does afflict <hi>Common-wealths</hi> by Peſtilence, Famines, and Wars; and yet they do not periſh by theſe calamities. They continue a long time under them, and ſometimes do regain their former luſtre after them. This principle muſt be carefully minded, becauſe all other Interpreters have been miſtaken; either through their not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to it, or their not due underſtanding of it. This they have underſtood, that we ought not to place the beginning of the pouring out of the <hi>viols,</hi> untill after that we ſee the Empire of <hi>Popery ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly</hi> to <hi>fall.</hi> Hence ſome have not placed their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, till after the preaching of <hi>Luther.</hi>

The ſecond Principle, <hi>That theſe ſeven viols do certainly ſignify ſeven periods of time, which ought to be diſtinguisht one from another.</hi> As the ſeven Seals and ſeven Trumpets in the preceding Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters did ſignify ſeven periods, which ſucceeded one to another the figurative expreſſion of <hi>viols,</hi>

'Tis true, that the plagues are not alwayes reſtrained unto the duration of the viol, or of the Period marked by the viol, but ſometimes do reach both before and after it; the reaſon of which we will give hereafter. This again is a Principle which hath not at all been taken notice of: the <hi>viols</hi> and <hi>plagues</hi> have been confounded by Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters, as if they were one and the ſame thing, and almoſt all of them have been placed in the ſame time.</p>

This is the firſt plague, and the firſt pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod of <hi>Antichriſts declining;</hi> this period laſted above a 150 <hi>years;</hi> for this corruption continued for a good ſpace of the eleventh <hi>Age.</hi> The ſecond and third plagues are thus ſet down.</p>
                        <p>v. 3. <hi>And the ſecond Angel pour'd out his viol upon the ſea, and it become as the blood of a dead man, and every living ſoul dyed in the ſea.</hi>

<pb n="83" facs="tcp:95320:203"/>turn'd into blood, and every living ſoul dyed.</hi> What more native and lively repreſentation could have been made of the Rage of the <hi>Croiſades.</hi> In all languages and in all ſorts of ſtyle, a <hi>ſea of blood, rivers of blood, ſtreams of blood,</hi> ſignify a very great ſlaughter. Now the proper Character of the <hi>Croiſades,</hi> is ſlaughter, murther, which falls not upon the <hi>head</hi> of the <hi>Antichriſtian Empire,</hi> but upon the <hi>people,</hi> all was there turn'd into blood. Never was there ſuch a prodigious effu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of blood in the <hi>ſea, i. e.</hi> among the peoples. In the firſt <hi>Croiſade,</hi> there dyed more then two millions of men in three or four year. 'Tis evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that God did lead theſe wretched creatures, as it were to the ſhambles, that they ſhould find the puniſhment of their crimes: the took away ſo great a quantity of blood, that he might cure the Ulcers of <hi>Chriſtendom.</hi> For that he might purge it of that <hi>vaſt rabble,</hi> he permitted the Devil to inſpire them, either with ſuch a ſottiſh ſuperſtition, or an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant ambition; that they muſt go and deliver the <hi>holy Land,</hi> or go and conquer <hi>Kingdoms</hi> in the <hi>Eaſt.</hi> This plague lighted only on the <hi>ſea,</hi> not at all on the <hi>dry land:</hi> upon the ſubjects of the <hi>Popedom,</hi> not at all upon the <hi>Popes.</hi> On the contrary, the <hi>Popes</hi> improved that evaſion to greaten their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, to plunder whole Countries, to make Generals of Armies, to act as ſoveraign Monarchs, and to lay a heavier yoke upon <hi>Kings:</hi> whom they order'd to march, and ſent them as their ſlaves into the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> and during their abſence plundred their Kingdoms.</p>
                        <p>We muſt not imagine that all the <hi>plagues</hi> laid down by St. <hi>John,</hi> muſt tend to the ruin of the <hi>See of Rome,</hi> or to the diminution of its power; for ſome are to light upon the <hi>head</hi> of that <hi>Empire,</hi> to cruſh

                        <p>This plague of the <hi>Croiſades</hi> is divided into <hi>two</hi> plagues, becauſe of its long duration, for it laſted 200 <hi>years,</hi> from the end of the <hi>eleventh</hi> Age, untill the end of the <hi>thirteenth.</hi> The third <hi>viol</hi> which makes the third <hi>plague,</hi> fell only upon rivers, <hi>i. e.</hi> upon leſſer waters; becauſe after a hundred years the fury abated, there was no more marching of the whole <hi>Weſt</hi> unto the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> only that of ſome particular nations, as of the <hi>Freneh</hi> among others under the conduct of <hi>St. Lewis;</hi> and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the effuſion of blood was much leſs, there were only rivers of blood, whereas the former <hi>Croiſades</hi> had made a <hi>ſea.</hi> I ſhall add this explication which I have given, does exactly agree with the Genius and Emblems of the Prophets. The Prophet <hi>Ezec.</hi> 32.6. ſays to Egypt, <hi>I will water with thy blood the land wherein thou ſwimmeſt, even to the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains.</hi> There muſt be no leſs then a ſea of blood, to overflow a Countrey with blood, even to the tops of the mountains. <hi>The mountains shall be melted with their blood,</hi> ſaith <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 34.3. there muſt be rivers of blood to do this.</p>
                        <p>v. 5. <hi>And I heard the Angel of the waters ſay, Thou art righteous, O Lord, which art, and waſt, and shall be, becauſe thou haſt judged thus:</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>v. 6. <hi>For they have shed the blood of Saints and Prophets, and thou haſt given them blood to drink, for they are worthy.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>There will not want ſome, who from theſe words will object and ſay, that untill this time there had been no perſecution on the account of Religion, and that the <hi>Popedom</hi> had in no wiſe ſhed the blood of Saints of Prophets. To this I anſwer. Firſt,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:95320:204"/>'Tis not true, that during the time of the <hi>Croiſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Why God chargeth <hi>Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Rome,</hi> with the blood which she had not yet shed.</note> no blood had been ſhed on the account of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; for it was exactly in the middle of the <hi>Croi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſades,</hi> that that horrible barbarity was uſed againſt the <hi>Waldenſes</hi> and <hi>Albingenſes. Innocent</hi> III. pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſht the fifth <hi>Croiſade</hi> at the end of the <hi>twelfth Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury,</hi> and at the ſame time gave ſentence of death againſt the poor <hi>Albigenſes.</hi> But that which is eſpecially to be obſerved in this matter, is this, that thoſe who make this objection, muſt make a ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger againſt thoſe words of Jeſus Chriſt,<note place="margin">Luc. 11.50, 51.</note> 
                           <hi>That the blood of all the Prophets, which was shed from the foundation of the world, may be required of this gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. From the blood of Abel,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>verily I ſay, it shall be required of this generation.</hi> What reaſon to require of the <hi>Jews,</hi> who lived in the times of Chriſt, the blood of <hi>Abel</hi> and other holy men, who were ſlain before the <hi>Flood?</hi> what reaſon to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of them the righteous blood, ſhed before <hi>Abraham?</hi> Nay, what reaſon to require of them the blood of the <hi>Prophets</hi> ſlain by their fathers, ſince they diſapproved the deeds of their fathers? Why, this is the reaſon, God when he executes judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ought to hear the cries of all the righteous blood that is ſhed; for theſe cryes make up but <hi>one</hi> voyce; and the race of murtherers makes up but <hi>one</hi> people, on which God will charge that blood. It matters not, that it was ſhed by the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents or the Children, before the one were born, or after the death of the others, this makes no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence; God looking upon this murthering race all in one body, will charge the whole upon the whole in the lump. Which evidently appears from that which God here ſpeaks of this generation of <hi>Antichriſt; they have shed the blood of Prophets,</hi> he ſaith not <hi>of Apoſtles,</hi> he goes back as far as the
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:95320:205"/>Prophets, and inflicts the puniſhment of the blood of the Prophets, ſlain ſo many ages before upon the <hi>Antichriſtian Empire. Rome</hi> hath always been a <hi>murthering City;</hi> the holy <hi>Apoſtles, Martyrs, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, Confeſſors</hi> of the firſt ages of Chriſtianity, were ſlain by its orders and in its Dominions. Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern <hi>Rome,</hi> within the circuit of its Juriſdiction, hath ſhed an infinite quantity of holy and faithfull blood. The old and new <hi>Rome,</hi> in the account of God, and in the executing of his judgements, make up but <hi>one body,</hi> becauſe God beholds the whole in one inſtant or point. He looks upon her as <hi>one</hi> murthering tyrant, as <hi>one</hi> race of manſlayers. It matters not, that as to ſome particular perſons, and ſome particular ages, ſhe is not guilty of the blood of the Prophets; ſhe is guilty as to <hi>her whole,</hi> in her beginning and her end: now the beginning and the end do involve the middle.</p>
                        <p>But it will be objected, Had not <hi>Rome Pagan</hi> been ſufficiently puniſht for the blood of <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and <hi>Maryrs,</hi> which ſhe had ſhed? So many ſack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and deſolations as ſhe had felt, did not they ſuffice? Muſt <hi>Antichriſtian Rome</hi> pay once more for that blood? I will object on the ſame grounds; Had not <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the mutherer of the <hi>Prophets,</hi> ſuffer'd enough for her murthers, by that diſmal deſolation made by the <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> by the captivity of all her Inhabitants, by the fire which conſumed her Palaces? Muſt God chaſtiſe her by the <hi>Romans</hi> for thoſe crimes, which had been puniſht by the <hi>Babylonians?</hi> Thus was it neceſſary that God ſhould puniſh <hi>Rome Antichriſtian,</hi> for the crimes commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by <hi>Rome Pagan,</hi> or for the ſins which were not committed till the following ages of this <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian Rome?</hi> 'Tis to this objection, that the other Angel anſwers, who ſpeaks at</p>

                           </note>That the <hi>Antichriſtian Kingdom</hi> is treated of here, is generally agreed to: therefore it cannot be doubted, that the <hi>Sun</hi> is the Soveraign of this Kingdom. The heat and beams are the inſtruments by which the Sun operates. 'Tis by his beams that he quickens, warms, and begets, and cauſeth fertility, when his heat is moderate, as he cauſes ſterility when it is exceſſive.

                        <p>Authority and power in <hi>Soveraigns</hi> exactly cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpond to heat and light in the Sun: 'tis this <hi>Author<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> which warms and burns, which ſaves and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroys, which does good and hurt.

Perhaps ſome will make one, that this fourth Plague did begin before the ſecond, for the prodigious tyranny of the <hi>Popes</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan under <hi>Hildebrand,</hi> nam'd <hi>Gregory</hi> VII. about the year 1074, and the <hi>Croiſades</hi> did not begin till 1096. more then 20 <hi>years</hi> afterward. Wherefore then does the Spirit make this to be the <hi>fourth</hi> Plague, and not the <hi>ſecond?</hi> I anſwer, becauſe this came down lower then the continuance of the <hi>Croiſades.</hi> The <hi>Croiſades</hi> ended about the year 1270. when as this <hi>papal tyranny</hi> continued in all its ſtrength, and all its dreadfull effects, the whole <hi>thirteenth</hi> and the whole <hi>fourteenth Centuries.</hi> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, though the <hi>Popes</hi> have ever kept up (and do ſtill) the ſame pretentions, notwithſtanding they did far leſs miſchief in <hi>Europe,</hi> by the uſe of this proud <hi>Authority,</hi> which they take to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>

There is another objection which will ſeem ſtronger, but notwithſtanding is more eaſily an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd. According to our expoſition, the <hi>augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi> of the <hi>papal Authority,</hi> is accounted (to be) a calamity upon the <hi>Antichriſtian State;</hi> whereas on the contrary, it is the higheſt ſtep of its exalta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and perfection. I anſwer, that the one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicts not the other: for firſt, we muſt remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the remark already made, <hi>viz.</hi> that theſe <hi>plagues</hi> do not <hi>all</hi> fall upon the <hi>head</hi> of the <hi>Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Kingdom:</hi> they are heavy judgements of God, which often touch not the <hi>Pope,</hi> who is the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to execute them. The plagues fall <hi>on them that worship the Beaſt and his Image,</hi> and not on the Beaſt himſelf, and on the falſe Prophet; yea, this <hi>falſe Prophet</hi> is an Inſtrument in the hand of God to inflict the <hi>plagues.</hi> Thus in the ſecond and third <hi>plagues,</hi> which are the <hi>Croiſades,</hi> the <hi>Pope</hi> is not the <hi>ſufferer;</hi> 'tis he who makes others ſuffer, 'tis he who ſends many millions of his ſubjects to be murther'd and ſlain; yea, this very thing proved a great augmentation of his power. In the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, this fourth <hi>plague</hi> falls upon the <hi>Antichriſtian people,</hi> and therefore in the following plague the Spirit ſaith, that the viol was pour'd on the <hi>ſeat of the Beaſt,</hi> to ſignify that the people or ſubjects of the Beaſt, ſhould not be the chief ſufferers by it.</p>

                           </note> This <hi>City</hi> upon the pouring out of the ſeventh viol, was <hi>to be divided into three parts.</hi> This is exactly come to paſs at the preaching of the <hi>Reformers,</hi> the <hi>Antichriſtian King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> was divided into three: <hi>one</hi> part remain'd with <hi>Antichriſt, one</hi> part did ſeparate from him, under the name of the <hi>Ausburg Confeſſion.</hi> A <hi>third</hi> part did ſeparate under the <hi>Confeſſion</hi> of thoſe who are barely ſtyled the <hi>Reformed; Sweden, Denmark,</hi> and a great part of <hi>Germany</hi> make the <hi>ſecond</hi> part. <hi>England,</hi> the <hi>

Theſe are the <hi>three</hi> grand parts, that divide the <hi>We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtern Church,</hi> which is the great <hi>City.</hi> Let this be attentively minded; for I affirm, that this paſſage does as it were ſpeak with a tongue, and is able
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:95320:222"/>alone to convince, that our <hi>Syſtem</hi> of the <hi>ſeven plagues</hi> is a moſt undoubted truth. This diviſion of the <hi>great City</hi> into <hi>three</hi> parts, ſo clearly points out the three <hi>Communions</hi> of the <hi>Latin Church,</hi> that to deny it can proceed onely from unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able paſſion, and opiniatrety. And if we have <hi>hit</hi> upon the <hi>truth</hi> in this <hi>point,</hi> we have done ſo in <hi>all;</hi> for if this Character of the <hi>ſeventh plague</hi> is true, and is already <hi>accomplisht,</hi> all the other <hi>plagues</hi> are alſo <hi>accomplisht;</hi> and if they are accompliſht, I do bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affirm, they cannot be apply'd to any other events, then thoſe to which we have apply'd them.</p>
                        <p>And it muſt not be hoped, that to obſcure this evidence, a <hi>fourth part</hi> may be made, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Church of England,</hi> becauſe of the <hi>controverſies</hi> about <hi>Church government;</hi> for the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> never refuſed to receive other <hi>Reformed</hi> ones into her <hi>Communion,</hi> nor have theſe again ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to receive her into theirs. We have alway profeſſed the ſame <hi>Religion</hi> with the <hi>Church of England,</hi> on the account of the perfect agreement of our <hi>Doctrine,</hi> notwithſtanding the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of <hi>diſcipline</hi> and <hi>government.</hi> When as the <hi>Lutherans</hi> have conſtantly refuſed to receive the <hi>Reformed</hi> into their <hi>Communion.</hi> There is among the <hi>Lutherans</hi> themſelves a difference in point of government. <hi>Sweden</hi> hath <hi>Bishops, Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark</hi> hath none, at leaſt not ſuch <hi>Bishops</hi> as thoſe of <hi>Sweden</hi> and <hi>England;</hi> and nevertheleſs, this makes not a different Sect.

                           <pb n="221" facs="tcp:95320:222"/>grand parts, into which the <hi>Latin Church</hi> is divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, <hi>i. e.

                        <p>THe bodies of the <hi>two Witneſſes</hi> muſt remain <hi>dead</hi> only <hi>three days and a half, and after theſe three days and a half, the ſpirit of life from God shall enter into them, and they shall ſtand upon their feet.</hi> In my <hi>Prejud, againſt Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery,</hi> I fixed theſe three days and a half, upon
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:95320:238"/>that ſpace of time which laſted from the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Baſil,</hi> and deſtruction of the <hi>Taborites,</hi> untill <hi>Luther:</hi> during which time it ſeem'd as if the <hi>witneſſes</hi> had been <hi>dead:</hi> But I have wholly aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned that conjecture, after I had ſeriouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered it. Firſt, becauſe in that ſpace of time, the <hi>Witneſſes</hi> were buried as well as ſlain: 'tis true, there continued ſome remainders of <hi>Calixtins</hi> in <hi>Bohemia,</hi> but they deſerve not to be reckoned as a <hi>body:</hi> Again, 'tis not uſual in Scripture to take a broken number, as this of <hi>three years and a half,</hi> to denote an uncertain and indefinite number, as I obſerved above: ſo that I am perſwaded, that theſe three <hi>days</hi> and a half, are three <hi>years</hi> and a half; a day ſtanding for a year, as the three years and a half are 1260 <hi>years,</hi> taking a <hi>year</hi> for a <hi>day.</hi> 'Tis therefore three years and a half, during which the external profeſſion of the <hi>Truth</hi> muſt be altogether ſuppreſſed; and after which it ſhall be rais'd again to life. And as I reject my own notions, I would not that any ſhould embrace thoſe of <hi>Dr. More,</hi> who hath lately wrote upon the <hi>Revelation.</hi> He will have the three <hi>days</hi> and a half <hi>here</hi> to ſignify the ſame thing, which the three <hi>years</hi> and a half do, <hi>viz.</hi> 1260 <hi>years</hi> of the reign of <hi>Antichriſt.</hi> But truly, he did not well conſider this point, when he wrote this; Firſt, this would be an affected and very profound obſcurity: after he had reduced the 1260 <hi>years,</hi> to 1260 <hi>days,</hi> which make three years and a half, then to reduce the ſame 1260 <hi>years</hi> to three <hi>days</hi> and a half. We cannot find an example, where the Holy Ghoſt ſets forth the <hi>ſame</hi> ſpace of time, and in the <hi>ſame</hi> place, after ſo <hi>different</hi> a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. But above all, we muſt take notice, that the Holy Ghoſt does <hi>here</hi> in a moſt exact manner di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh theſe four things.

He that will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found the two laſt of theſe, <hi>viz.</hi> the 1260 <hi>years,</hi> and the three <hi>days</hi> and a half, muſt alſo confound the two firſt, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>propheſying cloathed in ſackcloth, and the lying dead in the ſtreet of the City:</hi> but certainly, nothing is more different then to propheſy, and to lye dead: at leaſt, it muſt be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, that the <hi>Witneſſes</hi> propheſy while they are dead. For their propheſying and their death, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing exactly fixed on the ſame <hi>period,</hi> denoted by 1260 <hi>days,</hi> and by three <hi>days</hi> and a half, they muſt happen at the ſame time. But how can it enter into any mans head, that dead men can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſy? And who ſees not, that their death does imply a ceſſation, and interruption of their teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony? But what need is there to reaſon about this thing, when the Text ſaith expreſly and in plain words, that the death of the <hi>Witneſſes</hi> muſt not happen, untill after their propheſying, and their witneſs-bearing 1260 days? <hi>And I will give power to my two witneſſes, and they shall propheſy a thouſand two hundred and threeſcore days, cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in ſackcloth.

                           <hi>We</hi> are in my opinion certainly in <hi>this perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> which muſt extinguiſh the <hi>true Religion</hi> for three <hi>years</hi> and a half: if we will reckon theſe three <hi>years</hi> and a half, from the <hi>abrogating</hi> of the <hi>Edict of Nantes,</hi> in the moneth of <hi>October</hi> 1685. the deliverance of the <hi>Church,</hi> will fall out in the <hi>year</hi> 1689, and this is abſolutely the conjecture of <hi>Monſieur du Moulin,</hi> in his <hi>Accomplishment of Prophecies;</hi> he hopes, that the perſecution of the Church by the <hi>Antichriſtian</hi> party, ſhall ceaſe in the year 1689.</p>

After this, he finds that the firſt <hi>perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution</hi> for the ſake of <hi>Religion,</hi> was that which was rais'd againſt <hi>Berenger</hi> in the <hi>eleventh</hi> Age, on the account of his ſentiment, concerning the <hi>real pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,</hi> in the year 1059.

'Tis plain, his ſuppoſitions deſtroy themſelves, or are not ſtrong. <hi>Firſt,</hi> 'tis not true, that the firſt <hi>perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
                           <pb n="255" facs="tcp:95320:239"/>on the account of <hi>Religion</hi> was that, which the <hi>Popes</hi> rais'd againſt <hi>Berenger:</hi> that which was rais'd by the <hi>Image-worshippers,</hi> againſt thoſe whom they call'd <hi>Iconoclaſts,</hi> or Image-breakers, was more cruel, and happened a long while be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. Again, what probability that the <hi>Popedom</hi> can reign or ſubſiſt 326 <hi>years</hi> without perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the true Chriſtians, as this <hi>hypotheſis</hi> ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth?

'Tis the horrible <hi>Edict,</hi> which commands, that the <hi>new Converts</hi> being ſick, ſhall <hi>communicate</hi> after the <hi>popish</hi> way: This is the <hi>worſt</hi> effect that ever was produced by the <hi>ſpirit</hi> of <hi>rage</hi> and reprobation.

The <hi>Edict</hi> ordains, that they who will not <hi>communicate,</hi> ſhall be ſent to the <hi>Galleys,</hi> if they recover. There is none who is ſo mortally ſick, that is ſure that he ſhall dye, and fearing to recover, he will alſo fear to go to the Gallies; and this affrighting object, is able to induce a ſick man to <hi>communicate</hi> without <hi>faith,</hi> and to <hi>worship that</hi> which he judgeth to be a <hi>piece of bread:</hi> that is to ſay, to commit a horrible <hi>ſacriledge,</hi> and an act of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> and conſequently to <hi>damn</hi> himſelf certainly. So that properly this <hi>Edict</hi> is a <hi>trick</hi> of the <hi>Clergy,</hi> to procure the <hi>dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi> of all the <hi>new Converts.</hi> This is perfectly to imitate that <hi>Italian,</hi> who, that he might take a compleat vengeance, having his enemy in his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, promis'd him his life, on condition, that he would deny God; which having done, he mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd

                           <hi>Chapter</hi> is a long deſcription of the <hi>ruin</hi> of the <hi>Antichriſtian</hi> and <hi>Babylonian Empire.</hi> I have no need to enter into this Chap. becauſe I find nothing in it of that which I principally ſeek, which is, thoſe certain <hi>characters</hi> which can inform us of the time of this <hi>fall;</hi> namely, whether it be night at hand, or afar off. There is nothing <hi>there</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it, except that which is general. As to this <hi>Chapter,</hi> I will ſay only. <hi>Firſt,</hi> We muſt remember the remarque, which hath been often made by us, that Babylon <hi>here</hi> does not ſignify ſtrictly the <hi>City of Rome,</hi> as moſt have imagined. 'Tis the <hi>whole Babylonian Empire,</hi> as appears from theſe words, <hi>Come out of Babylon my people.</hi> I do not think, that any great number of <hi>Gods people,</hi> hath come out of the <hi>City of Rome;</hi> hitherto we have not ſeen it. My <hi>ſecond</hi> remarque is, we muſt not (as is uſually done) over much preſs the myſtical ſenſe of <hi>divers merchandiſes,</hi> which are reckon'd up, and were ſold it that <hi>City.</hi> I do not believe,<note place="margin">VVe muſt not over much ſeelt myſteries in the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſes of <hi>Babylon.</hi>
                           </note> that there is any other myſtery in this thing, than that this <hi>Babylonian Empire</hi> being ſet forth under the Emblem of <hi>a great City,</hi> it was neceſſary to repreſent it as a <hi>City</hi> of great <hi>commerce;</hi> for that is inſeperable from great Cities. Not but that theſe merchandiſes, and the many inſtruments of Luxury and pleaſures, which are ſaid to have been in this <hi>City,</hi> do not very fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſignify, and according to the deſign of the Holy Ghoſt, both the <hi>Simony</hi> and <hi>debaucheries</hi> of this <hi>corrupted Church</hi> in the general. But I believe not
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:95320:248"/>that 'tis neceſſary to enquire particularly what is meant (for example) by the ſilk, the precious ſtones, the fine linnen, &amp;c.</p>

                           <hi>Chapter</hi> is, we muſt not interpret literally the Metaphors of <hi>burning, fire, blood,</hi> and <hi>ſlaughter,</hi> which the Holy Ghoſt ſet before us. Certainly, theſe are not the Methods which God makes uſe of to eſtabliſh his <hi>Kingdom.</hi> I think indeed, as I have already ſaid, that God will ſuffer <hi>Rome</hi> to be <hi>ſackt,</hi> as he ſuffer'd <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to be: I further believe, that this great change in <hi>Religion,</hi> will not be made without blood ſhed, as it hapned in the laſt age.

                           <hi>Chapter</hi> is the laſt in which mention is made of the deſtruction of <hi>Antichriſts Kingdom.</hi> The ten firſt <hi>Verſes</hi> of this Chapter muſt not be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned from the fore-going <hi>Chapter,</hi> for they are only the continuation of it; The ſolemn rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cings of the <hi>Elect,</hi> after the <hi>ruin</hi> of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and the conſummation of the <hi>Chriſtian Church,</hi> here below upon Earth.</p>
                        <p>The eleven laſt <hi>Verſes</hi> of the <hi>Chapter,</hi> contain a wonderful viſion, wherein <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> appears ſitting upon a white Horſe, having the titles of <hi>faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,</hi> of <hi>true,</hi> of the <hi>word of God,</hi> of <hi>King of Kings,</hi> of <hi>Lord of Lords.</hi> He gathers his armies together, to fight againſt the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> and againſt the <hi>falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet.</hi> An Angel ſtands in the Sun, and calls to all the fowls of Heaven, to come and eat the fleſh of thoſe men that muſt be ſlain in that great battel, which was to be fought. On the other ſide, the <hi>Beaſt</hi>
                           <pb n="273" facs="tcp:95320:248"/>and the <hi>falſe Prophet</hi> gather their forces; the battel is fought; the <hi>Beaſt</hi> and <hi>Kings</hi> are overcome; he is taken with his <hi>falſe Prophet;</hi> both are caſt into the lake of fire and brimſtone, together with all thoſe who had worſhipt the <hi>Image of the Beaſt.</hi> And this is magnificent, and the Figures are lofty. But there is nothing new in this; and in my judgement, 'tis nothing but a recapitulation of the fore-going <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,</hi> concerning the ruin of <hi>Antichriſts reign.</hi> The <hi>viſion</hi> of the eleventh <hi>Chapter</hi> is an Epitome of the <hi>viſions</hi> that follow, and this is properly an Epitome of the <hi>viſions</hi> which went before; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I do not judge it neceſſary to inſiſt upon it. Eſpecially, ſeeing nothing is found of that which we ſeek for; namely, the ſigns and marks by which it may be known, when and at what time the <hi>reign of Antichriſt</hi> muſt <hi>end.</hi> 'Tis in the 11, 14, and above all in the 16<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. <hi>Chapter,</hi> that we find the <hi>Characters</hi> of this <hi>end,</hi> and of the <hi>time</hi> in which it muſt come to paſs. Therefore it was neceſſary only, that we ſhould inſiſt upon thoſe <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</hi>

That we muſt not underſtand literally the expreſſions of <hi>war</hi> and <hi>deſtroying,</hi> that are uſed here: for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that <hi>Ieſus Chriſt muſt tread the wine-preſs of the wrath of God, that he muſt give to be eaten by the fowls, the flesh of Kings, of Captains, of mighty men, of Horſes, of free, and bond,</hi> &amp;c. Theſe are Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phors borrowed from <hi>war,</hi> and muſt be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood ſurably to the nature of this <hi>ſpiritual war,</hi> which Jeſus Chriſt muſt make againſt <hi>Idolatry, Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition, Hereſies,</hi> and <hi>Tyranny:</hi> his quarrel is with theſe, and not with <hi>men.</hi> Beſides the reaſons alledged, we have here a convincing one, that
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:95320:249"/>the <hi>Inſtrument</hi> of ſo many <hi>victories,</hi> and which muſt make ſuch a ſlaughter,<note place="margin">Verſ. 15.</note> is <hi>the sharp ſword, that comes out of the mouth of him who ſitteth upon the white horſe. And the remnant was ſlain with the ſword of him that ſat upon the horſe</hi>—<hi>and all the folws were filled with their flesh.</hi> Now all know, that this ſharp ſword, that comes out of the mouth of Jeſus Chriſt, is <hi>the Word of God;</hi> a ſpiritual ſword, which muſt act only ſpiritual ſlaughters, and which does not deſtroy the lives of men, but their manners and Idolatries. So that I fear, leſt thoſe are miſtaken, who hope to render to <hi>Babylon</hi> that which we have received form her; <hi>and in the cup which she hath filled, to fill to her double, i. e.</hi> to give her blood for blood, torment for torment. This is not the <hi>ſpirit</hi> of the <hi>true Church.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I have now done with this ſubject, and I think there remains but one thing to do, that I may give a clear <hi>Idea</hi> of our <hi>prophecies,</hi> and that is, to <hi>Epito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mize</hi> and rank, according to <hi>the order of time,</hi> the various <hi>events</hi> which relate to the <hi>ruin</hi> of <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſts Kingdom,</hi> which the Holy Ghoſt diſplaced and confounded, to the end that the <hi>prophecies</hi> might not be clearer than God did intend they ſhould be.

                           <item>8. The <hi>ſecond</hi> period of this <hi>ſeventh</hi> viol, is that ſeaſon and ſtate of reſt and victory, which the <hi>Papacy</hi> regain'd, and this <hi>period</hi> laſts from 1560, or 1570; for ſince that time <hi>Popery</hi> hath received
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:95320:250"/>no conſiderable check, but rather hath much prevailed; it hath made <hi>war</hi> againſt the <hi>ſaints,</hi> had hath overcome them.</item>
                           <item>9. Towards the concluſion of this <hi>ſecond</hi> period of the <hi>ſeventh</hi> viol, a ſore <hi>perſecution</hi> muſt happen. The <hi>Witneſſes</hi> clothed in <hi>Sackcloth, i.e.</hi> the faithful, who are under the Croſs, ſhall be oppreſſed, and remain <hi>dead</hi> in the <hi>ſtreet</hi> of the <hi>great City</hi> for three <hi>years</hi> and a half. That is, the <hi>profeſſion</hi> of the <hi>Truth</hi> ſhall be wholly <hi>ſuppreſſed:</hi> but the <hi>Truth</hi> it ſelf ſhall not be <hi>buryed,</hi> nor layd in the grave, nor for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten.</item>
                           <item>10. At the end of the three <hi>years</hi> and a half, ſhall begin the <hi>third</hi> period of the <hi>ſeventh</hi> viol, which the Holy Ghoſt calls the <hi>vintage.</hi> This is <hi>the total ruin of Antichriſts Kingdom,</hi> and this period ſhall laſt 20, or 25 <hi>years;</hi> 'tis probable that it will <hi>begin</hi> about the <hi>year</hi> 1690, or a little while after.</item>
                           <item>11. the firſt thing, which ſhall be done in the <hi>third</hi> period of the <hi>ſeventh</hi> vial, is the <hi>Fall</hi> of the <hi>tenth</hi> part of the <hi>City, i. e.</hi> of <hi>the Kingdom of France,</hi> which ſhall break with the <hi>Kourt of Rome,</hi> and wholly change the face of <hi>Religion</hi> in that <hi>Kingdom.</hi> This is the firſt action of the <hi>vintage.</hi>

                           <p>The Reaſon why in this work we ſpeak of ſome things ſo poſitively. The linking together of our Principles, ſuffers us not to doubt, that we now are at the end of the reign of the papacy.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>IN the <hi>firſt Edition</hi> of this <hi>work,</hi> I did <hi>here</hi> finiſh what I had to ſay about thoſe events paſt and fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which concern the <hi>ruin</hi> of <hi>Antichriſts</hi> King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. <hi>Second Editions</hi> have this advantage, that they may be ſuted to the pallates of the <hi>Readers,</hi> of whom a tryal hath been made. And (were it poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for me to do it) I would gladly uſe this piece of prudence, with reſpect to a Remarque, which very many have made; namely, <hi>that in this diſcourſe we ſpeak over poſitively, and which too much confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, concerning things which at the moſt ought to be propounded only as conjectures.</hi> Perhaps ſome time or other men ſhall know <hi>the principal rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> which made me ſpeak in ſo <hi>confident</hi> a manner, and with ſuch tokens of <hi>aſſurance.</hi> In the mean while I deſire their attention to ſeveral things which I have to ſay.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">There are ſome things, that are propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only as ſtrong con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures.</note>The <hi>firſt</hi> is, That <hi>I do not ſpeak ſo confidently, as 'tis believed, concerning the moſt part of thoſe things which are yet to come:</hi> for example, I ſay not down <hi>the exact time of the reſurrection of the witneſſes.</hi> I do not ſay, that it ſhall be exactly in ſuch <hi>a year;</hi> for I have declared, and do ſtill declare, that I know not from what time God ſhall pleaſe to begin,
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:95320:251"/>the reckoning of the <hi>three years and a half;</hi> Not but that I ſtrongly hope, that God intends to begin it at the time of the <hi>Revocation of the Edict of Nantes:</hi> but this doth not riſe to a full aſſurance. That which concerns the <hi>riſing again</hi> of our <hi>Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation</hi> by way of <hi>inſpirations,</hi> the approaching <hi>Reformation</hi> of <hi>France</hi> by way of <hi>Authority,</hi> the <hi>fall</hi> of the <hi>tenth</hi> part of the <hi>City, i. e.</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> which ſhall forſake the <hi>papal Kingdom;</hi> this I ſay ſeems to me to be more than a <hi>conjecture,</hi> I confeſs it; and if things ſhould fall out other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, I ſhould be very much miſtaken. But however, if the <hi>fall</hi> of <hi>popery</hi> ſhould begin in ſome other <hi>place,</hi> I would ingenouſly confeſs that I was deceived, That the <hi>Countries, Kingdoms,</hi> and <hi>States,</hi> which are not under the <hi>papacy,</hi> ought not to be accounted <hi>the ſtreets of the great City,</hi> and that they muſt not feel an <hi>perſecution,</hi> ſeems to me more than probable, and I believe it. But not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, I declare, that I do not make it an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of faith; and if it ſhould fall out, that God ſhould ſend his deſolating ſcourge upon all the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches</hi> in <hi>Europe,</hi> without excepting the places where our <hi>Religion</hi> at this day bears ſway; I grant that men will have right to accuſe me, that I have gueſs'd wrong, but not that I made raſh con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions. And truly, when I conſider the <hi>horrible looſeneſs</hi> which every where prevails, I confeſs, that I cannot but fear leſt Good ſhould throw <hi>all</hi> into the ſame furnace.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">What is propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.</note>Behold therefore, what I <hi>aſſert,</hi> namely, that <hi>this is the laſt perſecution, which</hi> Antichriſt <hi>muſt raiſe againſt the Church, and that we are near the end of the twelve hundred and ſixty years</hi> (which is the Period of his <hi>Empire,</hi>) <hi>and that in the beginning of

Many will not forbear to judge me <hi>rash,</hi> becauſe I propound my conjectures about theſe things as certain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions. To this I have a <hi>ſecond</hi> thing to ſay, That none hath reaſon to be offended, that I am <hi>poſſeſſed</hi> with, and <hi>perſwaded</hi> of that, which I think I evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently ſee, and that I find the proofs of what I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound convincing to my ſelf. I ſhould do ill to demand of others the ſame aſſurance, and oblige them to entertain the ſame perſwaſion; I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the contrary in expreſs terms: I am well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent (as I have ſaid) that my Readers ſhould account theſe aſſertions to be conjectures, provided that I may have the liberty to believe what I ſee, or what I believe I ſee in the <hi>writings</hi> of the <hi>Prophets.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, it ſeems that there is no great neceſſity of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing me for this pretended raſhneſs; ſeeing if ſo be that I am miſtaken, <hi>Time</hi> is preparing for me a <hi>mortification</hi> ſore enough.

Behold the <hi>principles</hi> and their connexion.
<list>
                              <item>1. The firſt is, that <hi>the papacy is the</hi> Antichriſtian Empire <hi>of which theſe Prophecies ſpeak.</hi>
                              </item>
                              <item>2. <hi>That Idolatry is the principal Character of this</hi> Antichriſtian Empire.</item>

                                 <pb n="280" facs="tcp:95320:252"/>
3. <hi>That this</hi> Empire <hi>of the Beaſt muſt begin when the Roman Empire was divided into ten Kingdoms, and when that Heads (the Emperors) which was in the Apoſtle Pauls time, was deſtroyed.</hi> Here are <hi>three principles,</hi> which I know not how any <hi>Proteſtant</hi> can doubt of. We ſhall preſently ſee whither they will lead us.</item>
                              <item>4. My <hi>fourth principle</hi> is, that I have hit the truth in the explication of the <hi>ſeven viols,</hi> ſo that ſtinking ulcer in the <hi>firſt</hi> is <hi>the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible corruption of the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>in the tenth Age.</hi>
                              </item>
                           </list>
The Sea and rivers of blood in the <hi>two</hi> follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>plagues,</hi> are the <hi>Butcheries acted by the Croiſades,</hi> The encreaſe of the Sun's heat in the <hi>fourth plague,</hi> is <hi>the encreaſe of the papal authority:</hi> the Ecclipſe and darkning of this Sun in the <hi>fifth plague,</hi> is <hi>the grand Schiſm between</hi> Rome <hi>and</hi> Avignon: the Kings of the Eaſt, who paſs over <hi>Euphrates,</hi> in the <hi>ſixth plague,</hi> are <hi>the Turks, who paſs over the</hi> Bos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorus <hi>to invade the remainder of the Greek Empire, and a part of that of the Latins:</hi> and laſtly, the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding of the great city into <hi>three</hi> parts, in the <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth plague,</hi> is <hi>the dividing of the Latin Church into three Communions, Papiſts, Lutherans, and Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.</hi> I lay down as a <hi>principle,</hi> which I cannot doubt of, that I have it the mark in the <hi>explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of theſe <hi>plagues.</hi> But this ('tis ſaid) ſeems <hi>rash,</hi> to aſſert ſo confidently that which can only be a ſtrong conjecture. Men may object what they pleaſe againſt this expoſition, but I cannot recant it. And I deſire the World ſeriouſly to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der only theſe <hi>two</hi> things.
<list>
                              <item>1. <hi>That my explications very well agree with the words and Metaphors of the prophecy.</hi>
                              </item>
                              <item>2. <hi>That 'tis impoſſible that chance should produce an explication ſo univerſally lucky.</hi>
                              </item>
                           </list>
It muſt be remembred what we ſaid concerning the <hi>Epiſtles</hi> to the <hi>ſeven Churches,</hi> on the queſtion,
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:95320:252"/>whether they are <hi>Prophetical?</hi> We granted, that there are ſome paſſages that agree well with the applications which are made: but we obſerved, that theſe applications are far from being univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally <hi>true:</hi> 'tis therefore <hi>chance</hi> that produced thoſe lucky agreements. But if any one comes, who ſhall make ſuch a meaſured diviſion of <hi>times,</hi> and ſuch a juſt application of theſe times, and the events in them, unto the <hi>Characters</hi> with which theſe <hi>ſeven Churches</hi> are marked, ſo that nothing is defective; <hi>then</hi> I ſhall remain perfectly ſatisfyed, that this laſt <hi>Interpreter</hi> hath exactly hit the <hi>truth;</hi> it will be no longer a conjecture. Let me therefore be permitted to remain per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, <hi>that I have hit the truth as to the ſeven plagues,</hi> ſeeing they ſo perfectly agree with tho events which are paſt.</p>
                        <p>My <hi>fifth Principle</hi> is, <hi>that I have not been leſs happy in hitting the true ſenſe of the harveſt and vintage</hi> in the <hi>fourteenth chapter.</hi> A man muſt be blind, if he ſees not, that theſe are the two parts of the fall of <hi>Babylon. Babylon is fallen, is fallen, that great city;</hi> and immediately after, this fall is divided into <hi>harveſt,</hi> and <hi>vintage:</hi> I cannot hinder my ſelf from ſeeing, that this ſignifies <hi>the firſt fall of Popery, by a firſt Reformation,</hi> which certainly is come to paſs: and <hi>the final fall of Popery, by a ſecond Reformation,</hi> which muſt come to paſs. None can, I think, ſeriouſly conſider the perfect agreement between the repreſentations and the Original, but be will be perſwaded that 'tis ſo.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. My <hi>ſixth</hi> and laſt <hi>Principle</hi> is, <hi>that we are in the laſt Perſecution which the Church muſt ſuffer, from the Kingdom of Antichriſt.</hi> And this laſt concluſion, ſo naturally and neceſſarily flowers
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:95320:253"/>from the foregoing ones, that none can acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the preceding, but he muſt likewiſe own the truth of this. Let us <hi>now</hi> ſee whither theſe <hi>Principles</hi> do lead us.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">All our Principles lead us unto the <hi>eighteenth Age</hi> to find the end of <hi>Antichriſts</hi> reign,</note>If the <hi>Papacy</hi> be the <hi>Antichriſtian Kingdom,</hi> then certainly the <hi>period</hi> of 1260 prophetick <hi>dayes,</hi> or 1260 <hi>years</hi> (which are aſſigned to the duration of the Kingdom of the Beaſt) belong to <hi>it.</hi> If the principal <hi>Character</hi> of this Kingdom is <hi>Idolatry,</hi> 'tis clear, we muſt begin to reckon the duration of this Kingdom from that time in which <hi>Idolatry</hi> was ſet up in the <hi>Church.</hi> Now 'tis certain, that the Idolatrous worſhip of <hi>Reliques</hi> and of <hi>Saints</hi> was fully eſtabliſht in the <hi>fifth</hi> Age: Reckon 1260 <hi>years</hi> ſince the <hi>fifth</hi> Age, this will bring you to the beginning of the <hi>eighteenth</hi> Age.</p>

                        <argument>
                           <p>Of the thouſand years reign. That in all the paſt time, there is not a time to be found, wherin Satan hath been bound. Four heads of argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to prove this reign. The firſt is, the fifth Monarchy, ſo plainly promiſed to the ſaints.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>WE have done examining that which relates to the <hi>fall</hi> of the <hi>Antichriſtian Kingdom.</hi> That we may keep our word, that we gave in the <hi>Title</hi> of our <hi>ſecond part,</hi> we muſt <hi>now</hi> enquire, what muſt happen to the <hi>Church</hi> after that <hi>great event.</hi> This laid down in the 20 <hi>chapter</hi> of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> in theſe terms.</p>
                        <p>v. 1. <hi>And I ſaw an Angel come down from heaven, having the key of the bottomleſs pit, and a great chain in his hand.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>v. 2. <hi>And he laid hold on the dragon, that old ſerpent, which is the devil and Satan, and bound him a thouſand years.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>v. 3. <hi>And caſt him into the bottomleſs pit, and shut him up, and ſet a ſeal upon him, that he should deceive the nations no more, till the thouſand years should be fulfilled; and after that he muſt be looſed a little ſeaſon.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>v. 4. <hi>And I ſaw thrones, and they ſat upon them, and judgment was given unto them: and I ſaw the ſouls of them that were beheaded for the witneſs of Ieſus; and for the word of God, and which had not worshipped the beaſt, neither his image, neither had received his mark upon their foreheads, or in their hands; and they lived and reigned with Chriſt a thouſand years.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="286" facs="tcp:95320:255"/>
v. 5. <hi>But the reſt of the dead lived not again, until the thouſand years were finished. This is the firſt reſurrection.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Behold the Text, which is the ſubject to ſo many doubts, and ſo many controverſies! Behold that which hath made the pretended Hereticks, who are call'd <hi>Chiliaſts,</hi> and <hi>Millenaries.</hi> I mean not thoſe <hi>Chiliaſts,</hi> who have believed a thouſand years reign of the Church, during which time it muſt enjoy (according to their opinion) the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and ſinful pleaſures of the world: theſe were filthy ſpirits, which came out of the Dragons mouth.</p>
                        <p>

                           </note>What do thoſe gain, who come <hi>three hundred</hi> years <hi>lower,</hi> and hold, that <hi>Santan</hi> began to be bound at the time of <hi>Conſtantin?</hi> They muſt upon that principle, place their ending at the <hi>year</hi> thirteen hundred, and ſo include within their <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod</hi> of the <hi>thouſand years</hi> the rage of the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> who hath fed upon the blood of the ſaints, the ſeductions of the falſe Prophet, who makes the Image of the Beaſt to be worſhipped, and the whole world to run after him, who obligeth all men to bear his mark upon their foreheads, who makes war againſt the <hi>Saints,</hi> and overco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth them. In one word, they muſt take in, into their <hi>Period</hi> of <hi>Santans</hi> binding, that ſpace of time, in which the <hi>Revelation</hi> ſets forth the <hi>Dragon</hi> as broken looſe, giving his power to the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> and devouring the whole world. Once again, this is a blindneſs which I cannot conceive.</p>
                        <p>If there was no other argument againſt theſe two <hi>Hypotheſes,</hi> this alone would be enough to convince me of their falſity; namely, the terrible confuſion into which theſe <hi>Authors</hi> do put the <hi>Viſions</hi> of the <hi>Revelation.</hi> To any one who hath ſtudyed them, it is evident, that the <hi>Prophet</hi> hath obſerved the <hi>Order</hi> of <hi>Hiſtory,</hi> at leaſt in the groſs of events. He had ſeveral <hi>viſions</hi> concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the ſame thing; and in the order of theſe vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, the order of all their circumſtances does not alwayes, in every thing, agree with the <hi>order</hi> of
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:95320:256"/>events, and this we have obſerved, and cleared. But I ſay it again, the groſs is alwayes according to the <hi>order</hi> of <hi>hiſtory:</hi> this order is obſerved in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> that the <hi>birth</hi> and <hi>progreſſes</hi> of <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſts</hi> Kingdom are laid down before its <hi>fall.</hi> Now the Authors we have ſpoken, do make S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

What mean thoſe words, <hi>After this</hi> (ſo the <hi>French</hi> verſion) which begin the 20 <hi>Chapter,</hi> and <hi>denote</hi> always not only the ſucceſſion of <hi>viſions,</hi> but of <hi>times?</hi> This work is already large than I intended to make it; but notwithſtanding I cannot forbear to lay down a few of our <hi>arguments,</hi> there are ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, that one might <hi>crush</hi> the contrary opinion with number: but I ſhall only urge the principal ones.

Lift up thine eyes round about and ſee: all they gather themſelves together, they come to thee; thy ſons shall come from far, and thy daughters shall be nurſed at thy ſide. Then thou shalt ſee, and flow together, and thine heart shall fear, and be enlarged, becauſe the abundance of the Sea shall be converted unto thee, and the forces of the Gentiles shall come unto thee,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And the ſons of the ſtrangers shall build up thy walls, and their Kings shall mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter unto thee; for in my wrath I ſmote thee, but in my favour have I had mercy on thee.</hi> All the reſt of the <hi>Chapter</hi> hath the ſame ſtrength, and the ſame ſenſe.</p>

Let any one tell us, what bleſſings the Nation of the <hi>Iews</hi> hath received by the <hi>Meſſiah?</hi>

Indeed 'tis a Poſition in true Chriſtianity, that <hi>the Iews shall be called again.</hi> A thouſand <hi>Oracles</hi> (ſome of which we have cited) promiſe this. The Miracle, by which God doth preſerve this Nation, proveth it, as I think moſt ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſiſtably.

This plainly ſpeaks, that God pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves them for ſome great work. Now this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuppoſed, that the <hi>Iews</hi> ſhall be <hi>converted,</hi> if preſently after, the World ſhall end, and if neither

                        <p>Here are infinite millions of <hi>ſouls</hi> of <hi>Iews,</hi> which periſh for ſeventeen hundred <hi>years</hi> together, only a ſmall number of this people ſhall be ſaved in the laſt <hi>years</hi> of the World.

                        <p>Beſides this, how can this thought be entertain'd, that all the <hi>terrible threatnings,</hi> that have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc't againſt the earthly <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> (and againſt the <hi>people of the Iſrael,</hi> according to the fleſh) have been accompliſht in the literal and ſtrict ſenſe, upon <hi>her</hi> and her <hi>children:</hi> and that the promiſes of <hi>grace</hi> and <hi>glory</hi> have not, muſt not be accompliſht, but only <hi>typically</hi> in thoſe forreign <hi>Nations,</hi> with whom <hi>she</hi> hath really no communion.

At the foot of theſe threatnings (which are in almoſt every page of the Prophets) we like wiſe read of great and emphatical <hi>promiſes</hi> of reſettling, return, of a glory, a reign, and of an Empire. The <hi>threatnings</hi> have had their accompliſhment upon the <hi>Iews,</hi> and ſhall the <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes</hi> have <hi>theirs</hi> only upon the <hi>Gentiles?</hi> This is not probable at all.

So that without doubt, the ſame thing is ſignified in both places: Namely, that <hi>great victory</hi> that the Lord Jeſus muſt gain over all the enemies of the <hi>Church;</hi> (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>period</hi> of the thouſand <hi>years.</hi>) An unbloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy victory, and which muſt be gain'd by the ſword of his mouth, <hi>i. e.</hi> his <hi>Word:</hi> But 'tis repreſented under the figure of <hi>war,</hi> according to the cuſtome of the Holy Ghoſt, who paints out <hi>ſpiritual</hi> vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctories, with colours borrowed from <hi>temporal</hi> ones.</p>
                        <p>Now I would fain know, for whom this <hi>victory</hi> diſcribed by <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> muſt be gain'd?

                        <p>It is certain, that it muſt advance their <hi>Nation</hi> to very great glory. But they are miſtaken.

                        <p>In this we have the true reaſon, why in the book of <hi>Revelations</hi> there is nothing formally ſpoken of the <hi>Recalling of the Iews.</hi> It would have been a very ſurprizing thing, that the Holy Ghoſt ſhould have omitted one of the moſt conſiderable events of the <hi>Church,</hi> in a book of <hi>Prophecies,</hi> containing the <hi>Hiſtory</hi> of it.

                        <p>This is the <hi>Kingdom</hi> that was promiſed to Jeſus Chriſt by the <hi>Angel,</hi> who fore-told his birth to the B.

                           <p>The fourth Head of Arguments, for the reign of a thouſand years, are the Types. Four Types of this Period; the Principal is the ſeventh day of the Creation, which is not an imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Type of Eternal Reſt, but of the Peace of the Church on Earth.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>I Come now to the <hi>fourth</hi> Head of <hi>Arguments. viz.</hi> the <hi>Types.</hi> They as well as the Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies are <hi>Pictures</hi> and repreſentations of <hi>future Events.</hi> They are not vain ſpeculations of <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines:</hi> and the Great wits that look upon them to be ſo, approach very near to Impiety. 'Tis very certain, that God hath been pleaſed to ſhadow forth his Myſteries in certain diſpenſations of his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. <hi>Saint Paul</hi> teacheth us, that <hi>Hagar</hi> the ſervant of <hi>Sarah, Sinai</hi> a Mountain in <hi>Arabia;</hi> were <hi>Types</hi> of the legal Inſtitution. As <hi>Sarah</hi> and <hi>Sion</hi> were alſo <hi>Types</hi> of the Covenant of Grace. That <hi>Melchiſedeck</hi> was a <hi>Type</hi> of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt: and in general, that the <hi>Law</hi> had <hi>shadows,</hi> of which the <hi>ſubſtance</hi> is to be found in Chriſt. The <hi>Types</hi> therefore are no falſe or deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Light whereby to judge, in caſe they be rightly uſed. Now I pretend, that all the <hi>Types</hi> make for the <hi>Reign of Chriſt</hi> before the end of the World.</p>
                        <p>We may find a great number of them. The Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptivity of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in <hi>Egypt</hi> was certainly a <hi>Type</hi> of
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:95320:273"/>that bondage under which the <hi>Church</hi> ſhould groan,<note place="margin">The deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance of Iſrael out of Egypt, figured that of the Church from under the bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt.</note> during the Reign of <hi>Antichriſt.</hi> The <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſtian Empire</hi> is therefore called <hi>Egypt.</hi> Now after the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were come out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> they entred into <hi>Canaan, the Land flowing with Milk and Honey;</hi> which did certainly prefigure the happy State of the <hi>Church,</hi> after all her enemies ſhould be ſubdued. 'Tis ſuppoſed, that the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> was the Image of that great and Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Dwelling, to which the faithfull ſhould be tranſported, after the <hi>laſt judgement.</hi> I deny it not. But you muſt know,<note place="margin">1. Type; the Reſt in the Land of Canaan.</note> that in the <hi>Old Teſtament</hi> the deſcriptions of the future Bleſſedneſs of the <hi>Church,</hi> by <hi>Emblems, Types, Figures,</hi> and meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorical <hi>reſemblances,</hi> have not their immediate relation to Eternal Bleſſedneſs. <hi>St. Paul</hi> hath told us, <hi>that eye hath not ſeen it, nor ear heard it, nor can it enter into the heart of man to conceive:</hi> and conſequently 'tis not that which the H. Ghoſt would immediately deſcribe, becauſe he would that we ſhould be kept ignorant of it. So that thoſe Deſcriptions have an immediate relation to the flouriſhing State of the <hi>Church</hi> in the <hi>laſt Period;</hi> and by analogy they may be transfer'd to the bleſſings of <hi>Paradiſe.</hi>
                        </p>

So doubtleſs the <hi>Church</hi> being delivered from the bondage of <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> ſhall return to its reſt here on Earth.</p>

'Tis that which may be found in the number of <hi>ſeven.</hi> 'Twill be granted that this is a myſterious and ſacred <hi>number,</hi> and that it ſignifies perfection: 'Tis on this account it is mentioned ſo often in the <hi>Apocalypſe;</hi> There are <hi>ſeven</hi> Churches, <hi>ſeven</hi> Stars, <hi>ſeven</hi> Candleſticks, <hi>ſeven</hi> Spirits, <hi>ſeven</hi> Lamps, <hi>ſeven</hi> Eyes, <hi>ſeven</hi> Horns of the Lamb, <hi>ſeven</hi> Plagues, <hi>ſeven</hi> Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets, <hi>ſeven</hi> Thunders, <hi>ſeven</hi> Viols. So in the Books of <hi>Moſes,</hi> the <hi>ſeventh</hi> day is Holy; and the <hi>ſeventh</hi> year, was the <hi>year</hi> of Reſt; and the <hi>ſeven times ſeventh</hi> year, was the great <hi>Jubilee;</hi> The living Creatures entred into the <hi>Ark</hi> by <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens;</hi> the firſt-born of every beaſt remained <hi>ſeven</hi> days with its Dam; the male Children were to be <hi>ſeven</hi> days old, before they were circumciſed; the Candleſtick of the Tabernacle had <hi>ſeven</hi> Lamps; a Woman after her uncleanneſs, a Leper after he was cured of his leproſy, were to be puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied for <hi>ſeven</hi> days. It would be too long to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite all the Examples of this nature which might be mentioned; for the number <hi>ſeven</hi> is almoſt every where to be found.</p>
                        <p>For what reaſon is it ſo? who ſees not that this <hi>number</hi> ſignifies Completion and Perfection? and of what can it ſignify the Perfection, if not of the greateſt work of God, that for which all his other works were wrought, that is, <hi>the Church?</hi> If then the 7th the be every where <hi>ſacred,</hi> why is not the <hi>ſeventh Period,</hi> reckoning from the creation of the World,
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:95320:274"/>alſo ſacred, and a Period of perfection? It will be ſaid, the number <hi>ſeven</hi> is ſacred becauſe of the <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day,</hi> which was conſecrated to the ſervice of God: but why hath God choſen the <hi>ſeventh day</hi> to be holy, and a day of reſt for man? is it not plainly to ſignify, that the <hi>ſeventh day,</hi> or the <hi>ſeventh Period</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> ſhall be a time of <hi>Holineſs, Tranquility;</hi> and <hi>Peace?</hi>
                        </p>

                           <note place="margin">The 7th day of the Creation, a type of the ſeventh pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod of the Church.</note>The <hi>ſeventh day,</hi> they farther tell us; was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated to Reſt and Holineſs; becauſe God crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the World in <hi>ſix</hi> days, and reſted on the <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth.</hi> Behold, now we are at the Spring Head, and can riſe no higher; but here alſo we ſhall find an excellent <hi>Type</hi> of our <hi>ſeventh Period.</hi> 'Tis here I would ask with boldneſs, Wherefore God created the World in <hi>ſix</hi> days, and reſted on the <hi>ſeventh?</hi> Why did he not imploy <hi>five</hi> days, <hi>eight, ten,</hi> or <hi>twelve</hi> in the work of Creation, but preciſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>ſeven?</hi> Certainly, the infinite wiſdom of God will not permit that he ſhould do any thing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reaſon. Here is this reaſon, becauſe he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to hold the <hi>Church</hi> in an imperfect ſtate for <hi>ſix Periods</hi> of Time, labouring in that great work for which he made all others, and cauſing it ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively to paſs through <hi>ſeven</hi> degrees.</p>
                        <p>We muſt not ſay that the Sabbath, the <hi>ſeventh day,</hi> on which God reſted, was the image of that great Reſt into which the <hi>Church</hi> is to be brought, after he ſhall have compleated it upon Earth; for the <hi>ſeventh Period</hi> ought to bear proportion to the other <hi>ſix;</hi> whereas Eternity hath none with Time, much leſs with <hi>one</hi> day. So that the <hi>ſeventh Period</hi> cannot be the <hi>Eternal</hi> Reſt. It muſt be a Time that bears proportion to the <hi>ſix</hi> preceding <hi>Periods;</hi> As then after <hi>ſix days</hi> of labour, God finiſht his work, by <hi>a day</hi> to which he affixt <hi>Holineſs</hi> and <hi>Reſt</hi>
                           <pb n="325" facs="tcp:95320:274"/>as its Characters, there muſt likewiſe be for the <hi>Church,</hi> after <hi>ſix days</hi> of ſins and ſufferings, <hi>one laſt day,</hi> that is to be diſtinguiſht by thoſe two Seals; <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Holineſs,</hi> upon Earth. Not but that the <hi>Sabbath</hi> is alſo a figure of the Eternal Reſt; but 'tis becauſe theſe <hi>thouſand years</hi> of <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Holineſs</hi> on Earth, ſhall be the image of that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Holineſs</hi> which the <hi>Church</hi> ſhall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy in Heaven; and ſo 'tis a mediate <hi>Type</hi> of the Eternal Reſt. Theſe <hi>thouſand years,</hi> I confeſs, have no proportion with Eternity, but it is not to be a <hi>Type</hi> in the duration of the Time, but in reſpect of the ſtate of <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Holineſs,</hi> Images of the Coeleſtial Peace. So theſe <hi>thouſand years</hi> may be <hi>Types</hi> of the Heavenly Glory: but the <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day</hi> could not be the immediate <hi>Type,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of what was ſaid before. Becauſe the <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day</hi> of the Creation is a <hi>Period</hi> of the ſame nature with the <hi>ſix</hi> preceding, and which by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent ought to bear proportion to them.</p>
                        <p>It will be ſaid, that <hi>'Tis eaſy to make theſe ſuppoſitions, hut difficult to prove them.</hi> But I have a ſure Method for the proof of this, when the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral parts of a Syſtem ſupport one another, even therein they are proved: in an <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> that is falſe, there is alway ſome part inconſiſtent with it ſelf. Now I will make it evident, that the <hi>ſeven days of the Creation,</hi> do perfectly anſwer to the <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Periods of the Church;</hi> that in every one of thoſe <hi>days</hi> ſuch works were wrought, which were exact <hi>Emblems</hi> of the <hi>Events</hi> which have happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and of the things which were done, in every <hi>Period</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> anſwering to every <hi>day.</hi> If I make it evident, that in the <hi>ſix Periods</hi> of the duration of the <hi>Church</hi> which are paſt, we have ſeen thoſe things which were painted out by the <hi>ſix

The firſt fault he is guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of, is, that he did not make a Syſtem of thoſe <hi>Myſteries,</hi> and of the <hi>ſeven days</hi> of the <hi>Creation.</hi> This is the reaſon why he doth not maintain his ground, but runs preſently into things improba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. There is nothing more lively or more taking than that which he hath conceived concerning the firſt <hi>three days.</hi> In the <hi>firſt</hi> he finds the Illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of man being ignorant: in the <hi>ſecond</hi> the work of Juſtification of man being a ſinner: in the <hi>third</hi> the Sanctification of man being unholy: and it muſt be confeſt, that ſo far nothing could be more happy, and argue greater ſtrength of Imagination. Theſe are excurſions out of the way, 'tis true; but they are ingenious. They are perticularly fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing to thoſe, who know that this great man always addicted himſelf to diſputations againſt <hi>Hereticks,</hi> which he managed after the way of the Schools, than which nothing doth more dull the fancy, and cauſe a barren imagination. When he comes to the <hi>fourth day,</hi> it is no longer ſo, and he is not ſo happy, he cannot but ſee there Jeſus Chriſt and the Church, in the <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Moon,</hi> as all others pretend; but he is ſufficiently puzled to
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:95320:277"/>make the connection between this <hi>fourth day</hi> and the preceding ones. He is yet leſs happy as to the <hi>two</hi> laſt <hi>days.</hi> He would have the <hi>Birds</hi> and the <hi>Fishes</hi> of the <hi>fifth day</hi> to ſignify the ſervice of God; that the <hi>Fishes</hi> do ſignify good motions of the heart, and the <hi>Birds</hi> viſible and outward acts. In the <hi>Beaſts</hi> of the field created on the <hi>ſixth day,</hi> he finds the Chriſtian vertues. All this is forced, and however he ſtretcheth his fancy to get through it, yet he doth not ſucceed. It may be ſaid, without doing him any injuſtice, that except the <hi>three</hi> firſt <hi>days</hi> of the <hi>Creation,</hi> there is nothing at all well conceived in that work of the <hi>Types.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The other fault of <hi>Placeaus,</hi> is that he took for the object of his <hi>Type</hi> of the <hi>Creation,</hi> Man to be delivered from miſery, <hi>Homo a miſeria liberandus:</hi> whereas 'tis certain, we muſt look there for the <hi>Church</hi> to be eſtabliſht, <hi>Eccleſia Conſtituendae.</hi> This is the great work of God, next to his own glory; 'tis the chief and only end of his works. 'Twas for the ſake of the <hi>Church</hi> that he <hi>created the World,</hi> and made all things; about this he hath been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed from Everlaſting, and will be ſo to Everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting. 'Tis the Spouſe of Chriſt, tis his other ſelf: we ought to find her every where, as God hath given her ſome place in all his works. Particulars were made for the <hi>Church,</hi> and not the <hi>Church</hi> for them. Therefore we ought not to look for the Type of the deliverance of <hi>Man</hi> in the <hi>Creation,</hi> any farther then we can therein find the <hi>Church,</hi> in which men are re-eſtabliſht and delivered. I therefore find my ſelf obliged to proceed farther in this inquiry, find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing at all in that which hath been ſaid by others, wherein I can perfectly acquieſce.

The
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:95320:278"/>firſt are the Lambs, born to eat the graſs which grows on the ſurface of theſe fields: I do not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute it to them as a fault not to penetrate farther. But I know not how to pardon thoſe pretended <hi>Divines,</hi> who tear out the very heart of the ſacred Scriptures, in the Myſteries and Divine depths therein, and leave it nothing but a bare ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficies. Let us give but <hi>two</hi> Examples of this <hi>Maxim</hi> of the <hi>Cabaliſts,</hi> that God hath imprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a ſeal of himſelf and of his Myſteries, which reacheth to all matters. The firſt is that of the <hi>Trinity of Perſons in a unity of eſſence,</hi> whereof we have a lively image in the World of Spirits, by the <hi>eſſence, intelligence,</hi> and <hi>will,</hi> which is found in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Spirit,</hi> whether ſeparate or united with matter: and another lively image of it in the three dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of matter, <hi>longitude, latitude,</hi> and <hi>profun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity,</hi> which are <hi>three</hi> diſtinct dimenſions, and yet make but <hi>one</hi> only and moſt ſimple extenſion. The other inſtance is in <hi>the myſtery of the Incarnation,</hi> and the perſonal union of the <hi>Divine</hi> uncreated <hi>nature</hi> with the <hi>humane;</hi> a myſtery whereof we ſee a lively image in the <hi>Incarnation</hi> of thoſe <hi>ſouls</hi> which God unites with <hi>matter.</hi> Theſe things de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve very well to be thought of. Beſides, that the Holy Ghoſt hath ſufficiently declared himſelf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning theſe Myſteries. He hath ſhown us one part, that we may imagine the reſt. He ſaith, that <hi>the light of the firſt day,</hi> is the image of that Action, whereby God cauſeth the light to ſhine in the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of our ignorance. The Scripture calls our Lord <hi>the Sun of Righteouſneſs,</hi> by alluſion to the <hi>Sun</hi> in the <hi>Heavens;</hi> a <hi>ſecond Adam,</hi> with reference to the Creation of the <hi>firſt Adam;</hi> the marriage of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> an image of <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>Church. Heaven</hi> is called <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> by alluſion to the <hi>Earthly
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:95320:278"/>Paradiſe.</hi> In a word, there are an hundred things in the work of Creation, whereof no <hi>natural</hi> reaſon can be given: there muſt be <hi>ſome</hi> therefore which are <hi>myſterious.</hi> Why (for inſtance) did God create a <hi>Chaos,</hi> before he put in order the ſeveral parts of the <hi>world?</hi> why he rank't them all in <hi>ſix days</hi> time, no more or leſs? why he created not the <hi>Sun</hi> but on the <hi>fourth</hi> day? why the <hi>Plants</hi> were created be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Sun?</hi> and why the <hi>Fishes</hi> and <hi>Brids</hi> before the <hi>Beaſts</hi> of the field?</p>

The Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture leads us by the hand in theſe paths, by the continual uſe of figures borrowed from the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible <hi>World,</hi> to ſignify thoſe parts of the intelligible one. From this principle we may conclude, that the creation of the <hi>ſenſible</hi> World is the image and <hi>Type</hi> of the Creation of the <hi>intelligible</hi> World. And conſequently that the Creation of the <hi>World</hi> is the Image of the different degrees, by which God hath made his <hi>Church</hi> to paſs through, to bring it to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</p>

In a third place, 'tis meant of the <hi>Heart</hi> ſanctified and ſerving God; 'tis a fault that is moſt obvious, and which alone is ſufficient to prove that he had no Syſtem, that they were only looſe thoughts which ſhined ſeparately, but did not mutually illuſtrate each other.</p>

                        <p>The great inequality that there is between theſe ſeveral <hi>Periods</hi> as to their duration, ought not to make any difficulty.

The <hi>Periods</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> muſt be computed by the great <hi>changes</hi> which have therein happened. Now 'tis exactly in theſe <hi>ſix</hi> points, that the <hi>Church</hi> hath changed its face. From <hi>Adam</hi> untill <hi>Abraham</hi> there was no change in the face of the <hi>Church;</hi> by <hi>Abraham</hi> it began to aſſume a new form, ſhe had then <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;</hi> and the diſtinction of People began. By <hi>Moſes</hi> the <hi>Church</hi> took another form, quite diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from the Preceding. By <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhe became incomparably more perfect. By the riſe and growth
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:95320:280"/>of <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> the <hi>Church</hi> was intirely changed. By <hi>Antichriſt's</hi> being at the <hi>Height,</hi> the <hi>Corruption</hi> was alſo at the <hi>Higheſt;</hi> and at length by the <hi>fall of Antichriſt,</hi> ſhe muſt put on another face.</p>

                        <p>Some will doubtleſs make an objection here on this account, that God is ſaid to be the Author of theſe <hi>Birds</hi> and <hi>Fishes.</hi> Which there is no reaſon for in the thing repreſented by the <hi>Type,</hi> becauſe God is not to be lookt upon as the <hi>Author</hi> of the Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, Idolatries, and corruption of the <hi>Papacy.</hi> I might reply, that no <hi>Typical</hi> relations ought to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, but that God may be ſaid the Author of, and give his bleſſing to thoſe Creatures which were good, in reſpect of their natural being; he did not bleſs the <hi>Chaos,</hi> 'tis true, but it was becauſe that in its natural being it was neither fair nor good, no more than in its <hi>typical</hi> relation. But if any will that the myſtery be carried farther, it may be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that God ſaith, <hi>Let the waters bring forth every moving Creature,</hi> &amp;c. 'Tis the waters that imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately produce'em. To the ſame effect as he ſaid before, <hi>Let the Earth bring forth Plants.</hi> For this

But it will be ſaid, that God bleſſed theſe works, <hi>He ſaw that it was good.</hi> Once more I may ask, why ſhould not God approve thoſe <hi>Creatures,</hi> which in their own natures were good; and which were <hi>typically</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent ſuch <hi>Events</hi> as the Providence of God would appoint for his own glory?

                           <hi>Then I ſaw a great white Throne, and him that ſat on it, from whoſe face the Earth and Heaven fled way, and there was found no place for them.</hi> White as well as Purple is a Royal co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, and withal a Prieſtly; for the Prieſts were clothed in white.

In like manner he that ſat upon the Throne is our King and Prieſt. The Earth and the Heaven fled from his face; for they ſhall be burnt, that they may be renewed.</p>
                        <p>V. 12. <hi>And I ſaw the dead ſmall and great ſtand before God,</hi> &amp;c. 'Tis a deſcription of the laſt Judgement, to the end of the Chapter; all this is plain.</p>

                           <hi>Chapter</hi> begins with theſe words, <hi>And I ſaw a new Heaven and a new Earth; for the firſt Heaven and the firſt Earth were paſſed away.</hi>

                        <p>V. 10. <hi>And he carried me away in the Spirit to a great and high Mountain, and showed me that great City, the Holy</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>deſcending out of Heaven from God.</hi> This is ſomewhat like what the Devil did unto Jeſus Chriſt, when he carried him up into an high Mountain, and ſhows him all the Kingdoms of the world: what the <hi>Devil</hi> makes appear by illuſion, <hi>St. Iohn</hi> ſees by viſion. That he was carried, or ſeemed to be carried, up into an high Mountain, makes it plain, that the <hi>Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> he was to be made ſee from thence, was here upon <hi>Earth,</hi> and not the Triumphant Church in <hi>Heaven,</hi> though it be called <hi>the Holy</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>deſcending out of Heaven from God.</hi> She ſhall be deſcended from Heaven, becauſe ſhe ſhall abound in Graces which come from thence: ſhe is called the <hi>great City,</hi> and 'tis the firſt time ſhe is ſo called.

                        <p>V. 12. <hi>And had a Wall great and high, and had twelve Gates, and at the Gates twelve Angels, and names written thereon, which are the names of the twelve Tribes of the children of</hi> Iſrael.</p>
                        <p>V. 13. <hi>On the Eaſt three Gates, on the North three Gates, on the South three Gates, and on the Weſt three Gates.</hi> In the deſcription of this <hi>City,</hi> we have every thing that is rich and precious, all ſignifies its great Holineſs, excellent Vertues, and perfect Peace; for they are the ſubſtantial Goods and real Treaſures of the Church. <hi>It had a great &amp; high Wall,</hi> by that is meant Divine Protection; which ſhows alſo that 'tis the <hi>Church upon Earth,</hi> which is ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of; for the Church in Heaven hath no need of <hi>walls,</hi> being out of the reach of Enemies.</p>

For by thoſe <hi>Tribes of Iſrael,</hi> we may not underſtand the <hi>Church</hi> of the converted <hi>Gentiles,</hi> they have a diſtinct place in what remains of the deſcription of the <hi>new Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem.</hi> So the twelve <hi>Gates</hi> at the four Cardinal points of the World, <hi>Eaſt, North, South, Weſt,</hi> are to the ſame effect as what God had ſaid in another place, <hi>I will call my Sons from far, and my Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters

                        <p>At every one of thoſe twelve Gates <hi>are twelve Angels;</hi> Theſe are the twelve <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> called Angels or Paſtors, who whether they ſhall be rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed from the dead or no, ſhall by their preaching and Doctrine guide the <hi>Iews</hi> to enter again into the <hi>Church,</hi> and open the gate unto them.

                        <p>V. 14. <hi>And the Wall of the City had twelve Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations, and in them the names of the twelve Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles of the Lamb.</hi> The protection, ſafety, and the Wall of the <hi>Church,</hi> depends on the foundations whereon ſhe ſhall be built.

                        <p>The Holy Ghoſt in what follows deſcribes theſe foundations, and aſſigns a precious Stone to each of 'em.</p>
                        <p>V. 19. <hi>And the foundations of the Wall of the City were garnished with all manner of precious Stones;
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:95320:294"/>the firſt foundation was Iaſper, the ſecond Saphire, the third a Chalcedony, the fourth and Emerald.</hi>

                        <p>V. 20. <hi>The fifth a Sardonyx, the ſixth Sardius, the ſeventh Chryſolite, the eighth Beryl, the ninth a Topaz, the tenth a Chryſopraſus, the eleventh a Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinth, the twelfth an Amethiſt.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>If we had leaſure and time to ſpare, we might compare the twelve <hi>Articles</hi> of the Chriſtian Creed to thoſe twelve <hi>Stones,</hi> and ſee wherein every Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of Faith might ſymbolize with every Stone.

                           <hi>And the building of the wall was of Iaſpar, and the City was of pure Gold like unto clear glaſs.</hi> The diſtinction of <hi>men</hi> according to their different qualities is conveniently and commonly enough made by the Emblem of <hi>Metals;</hi> men of low and baſe Spirits, ſunk into degeneracy and vice,

Laſtly, <hi>Gold</hi> is the Emblem of ſuch ſpirits as are pure, ſolid, firm, and truly vertuous. This is that which the H.

All the riches of the world cannot be a ſufficient price for 12 <hi>Pearls,</hi> big enough to make 12 <hi>Gates</hi> of Cities: and herewith we muſt know, that when the ſpirit of God puts ſo high a price upon weak men like our ſelves, when he calls them <hi>Iaſpars</hi> and <hi>precious ſtones,</hi> the <hi>Gates</hi> and <hi>Foundations</hi> of a <hi>City,</hi> he doth not look

                        <p>This Goſpell is the <hi>Pearl of great Price,</hi> which when one had found, he went his way, and ſold all that he had to purchaſe it. This is the <hi>Treaſure</hi> of which <hi>S.

                        <p>V. 22. <hi>And I ſaw no Temple therin, for the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are its Temple.</hi> This muſt be underſtood as the words of another <hi>Prophet,</hi> who ſpeaking of the <hi>Church</hi> in this period, ſaith, <hi>Every man ſhall not teach his Neighbour, for they ſhall be all taught of God;</hi> which doth not import that the Miniſtry ſhall be aboliſht, but that the increaſe of Knowledg ſhall be ſo great, that ordinary men might rather be Teachers, than need to be taught: doubtleſs there ſhall be Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples to the end of the world, and places ſet a part for publick worſhip.

                        <p>V. 23. <hi>And the City had no need of the ſun, nor of the moon to ſhine in it: for the glory of God did lighten it, and the Lamb is the light therof.</hi> Here the <hi>ſun</hi> and the <hi>Moon</hi> do ſignifie created <hi>lights</hi> which cauſe a ſucceſſion of <hi>day</hi> and <hi>night,</hi> and

                        <p>HAving confirmed the <hi>Truth</hi> of this <hi>Reign of Chriſt upon Earth,</hi> we ought now to conſider the <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Characters</hi> of it; they may be divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into two Claſſes; ſome that are <hi>doubtful,</hi> and others <hi>certain.</hi> It is fit that we begin with the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. We are not to reckon among the <hi>Characters</hi> of this <hi>Reign,</hi> either the <hi>fall</hi> of the <hi>Babylonish Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,</hi> or the <hi>converſion</hi> of the <hi>Iews,</hi> or the <hi>converſion</hi> of the remaining <hi>Gentiles.</hi> For theſe <hi>three</hi> things are to go before it. They can never be brought about, but with confuſion and Tumult. The <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish Empire</hi> cannot fall, but it muſt coſt blood, and make a mighty noiſe. The converſion of the <hi>Iews</hi> muſt needs be attended with great Commotions among the People, and it may be violent contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions. 'Tis likewiſe impoſſible to conceive, that the Converſion of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> can be brought about, without the utmoſt endeavours of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil to hinder it: he will raiſe all his forces every where, to hinder the laſt eſtabliſhment of this <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Chriſt,</hi> as he did in the firſt Ages of the <hi>Chriſtian Church.</hi> So that we cannot doubt, but he will cauſe great oppoſition, not only by words, but it may be blows. Now this cannot belong to
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:95320:301"/>the <hi>Kingdom of Chriſt,</hi> whereof the principal Character is <hi>Soveraign Peace.</hi> Inſomuch that we thus conceive of it.

<pb n="387" facs="tcp:95320:306"/>ſhall be increaſt, and become very conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.

Theſſal.</hi> 2. <hi>chap.</hi> 'tis ſaid, <hi>the Lord shall deſtroy the man of ſin, by the brightneſs of his coming.</hi> But all this is grounded on a <hi>falſe</hi> ſuppoſition; <hi>viz.</hi> that there ſhall be <hi>no other</hi> coming of Chriſt, but for the laſt &amp; final Judgement, which is not true: the coming of Chriſt here ſpoken of, is that to ſettle the Peace, and Glory, and Kingdom of his <hi>Church;</hi> and we may be certain, that this is meant in almoſt all the Paſſages, where the coming of Chriſt is ſpoken of. It is true, that when Chriſt ſhall come to deſtroy the <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian Kingdom,</hi> he ſhall not find true Faith upon Earth, that is, <hi>very little</hi> of it. Experience confirms this; for we are <hi>now</hi> in that very time. Farther, when Chriſt ſhall come the <hi>third</hi> and <hi>laſt</hi> time, for the laſt Judgment, it may well be, that there ſhall be a great ſcarcity of faith &amp; piety in the World at that time: for <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog</hi> ſhall be increas't, there ſhall be a great ſeduction upon Earth, and a great affliction upon the <hi>Church.</hi> So that theſe <hi>Prophecies</hi> ſhall have their accompliſhment whenever Chriſt comes.
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:95320:309"/>They were fulfilled at his <hi>firſt coming,</hi> when he came in the fleſh; for the <hi>Church</hi> was <hi>then</hi> exceedingly corrupted; and ſo at his <hi>ſecond coming,</hi> when he ſhall come to deſtroy the <hi>Antichriſtian Kingdom:</hi> For <hi>in our days,</hi> there is a very great <hi>corruption,</hi> and ſhall be at his <hi>third coming;</hi> for at the end of the world, there ſhall be an <hi>Inſurrection</hi> againſt the <hi>Church,</hi> and againſt the Son of God.</p>

For if juſt after the fall of the <hi>Antichriſtian Empire,</hi> the reign of Chriſt for a thouſand years muſt take place, we likewiſe know, that at the end of that Reign of a thouſand years, ſhall be the day of Judgment. <hi>Firſt,</hi> you muſt know, that our Lord J.
